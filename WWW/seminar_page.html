Title: Computing with Natural Language
Speaker: Prof. Percy Liang, Computer Science, Stanford University
Date: Monday, April 7, 2014
Time: 12:15 pm - 1:05 pm
Location: Building 460, Room 126

Abstract:
Today, the tremendous growth of semi-structured data far outpaces our ability to ask interesting deep questions of it.  Moreover, much of the advanced data processing and analysis is limited to the privileged few who have programming expertise.  In this talk, I will entertain the possibility of using natural language as a universal and agile interface for querying, and more generally computing with, data.  Specifically, I will discuss two recent projects: (i) learning to map natural language questions into database queries on Freebase; and (ii) learning to map natural language queries onto XPath expressions that extract entities from web pages.  In both these projects, I will discuss the statistical and computational challenges of learning from weakly-supervised data.

Title: Viral Gene Circuits: Simple Model Systems and a New Spectrum of Antiviral Targets
Speaker: Prof. Leor Weinberger, Biochemistry & Biophysics, UCSF
Organizer: Prof. Ron Dror, Computer Science, Stanford University
Date: Monday, April 7, 2014
Time: 4:15pm-5:15pm
Location: Y2E2, Room 111

In spring quarter the ICME Colloquium and LA/Opt seminars will be combined and will be on Mondays at 4:15pm in Stanford's Math Corner.
 
Ron Dror is organizing seminars around a computational biology theme.

Abstract: 
Viral gene circuits are bounded by many of the same design constraints as electrical circuits (e.g., signal-to-noise ratio) but rapidly mutating viruses, like HIV, evolved unique mechanisms to circumvent and even exploit these constraints.These adaptations are essential to the evolutionary fitness of viruses and present novel targets for antiviral therapy. I will describe two viral circuit adaptations, the first in HIV (see Weinberger & Weinberger, Cell, 2013) and the second in the human herpesvirus CMV (Teng et al., Cell, 2012), the leading cause of birth defects and transplant rejections. I will show how disrupting and exploiting these circuit architectures presents a new therapy spectrum.

Bio:
Dr. Weinberger’s primary research focuses on fundamental principles of gene regulation, and more specifically on the study of regulatory "master circuits" that control HIV and human herpes viruses. His laboratory employs a coupled, computational-experimental approach that relies on quantitative, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy with mathematical modeling to study viral gene-expression circuits and expression "noise" at the single-cell level.

Before joining the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology and UCSF in 2011, Dr. Weinberger was an Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego.

Dr. Weinberger is a member of numerous scientific societies and serves on the innovation review panel for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and on the board of advisors for the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis.

A number of prestigious organizations have recognized Dr. Weinberger’s innovative research mapping of the architecture of the HIV regulatory circuit. Most recently, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation named Dr. Weinberger a 2011 Sloan Research Fellow. Previous awards include the W.M. Keck Foundation Research Award, the California HIV/AIDS Young Investigator Innovative Development Award, a Bill and Melinda Gates Grand Challenges in Global Health Explorations Award, an NIH Director’s New Innovator Award and a Pew Scholarship in Biomedical Sciences.

Dr. Weinberger earned a bachelor’s degree in 1998 at the University of Maryland, College Park where he studied physics and biology. He then spent a year at the Los Alamos National Laboratory as a Department of Energy Scholar in the Theoretical Biophysics and Biology Group. In 2004, he earned a PhD in biophysics from the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Predoctoral Fellow. Dr. Weinberger then received postdoctoral training at Princeton University as a Lewis Thomas Fellow, working with Drs. Thomas Shenk and David Botstein.

Abstract:
Information theory has a history of marrying elegant mathematical models with a wide scope of applications. In an attempt to follow this tradition, we start with questions of universality in communications, and end with surprisingly deep connections to compression, unsupervised learning, and DNA sequencing.

Title: Browsing with Tor: Online Anonymity to Outsmart the NSA
Speaker: Tom Lowenthal, Technologist & Activist
Date: Tuesday, April 8, 2014
Time: 5:30pm-7:00pm
Location: Stanford Law School - Room 280B, 559 Nathan Abbott Way, Stanford, CA 

RSVP is required for this free event. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ENippC71lSPJp3_DnJZWoQWwQwpg4e2Xv5iPfyRI63g/viewform

Reception - 5:30pm 
Workshop - 6:00pm

Abstract:
In the NSA's "Tor Stinks" presentation, they call Tor "the king of high-secure [sic] low-latency Internet anonymity" with "no contenders for the throne in waiting", and admit that even with their vast resources and massive data-centers, even the NSA can only effectively attack a tiny fraction of Tor users at once. In this workshop, Tom Lowenthal --- formerly of the Tor Project -- will teach us how to use Tor to browse the web safely. We'll learn a little about how Tor works, and what Tor can and can't protect against. Audience members are encouraged to bring their laptops: this is a hands-on session. You should walk away with Tor installed, and confident you can use it safely. This session is open to folks of all experience levels.

Bio:
Tom Lowenthal is a technologist and an activist who specializes in operational security and grassroots surveillance self-defense. A year ago, his opinions on computer security sounded over-the-top, but now they barely seem adequate. He believes strongly in individual privacy & personal freedom and tries to avoid making eye contact with security cameras., which doesn't work nearly as well as it sounds. Tom works to improve the state of usable liberations technologies and teach at-risk users about the steps they can take to be safe. He previously worked as a paranoia advocate at Mozilla, and the Tor Project's coordinator. He holds a B.A. in Political Theory with Computer Science and Technology Policy from Princeton University.

Title: Resistive Switching Random Access Memory: Materials & Device Engineering for 3D Architecture
Speaker: Hong-Yu (Henry) Chen, Electrical Engineering, Stanford University
Advisor: Prof. H -S. Philip Wong
Date: Wednesday, April 9, 2014
Time: 9:00AM-10:00AM (Refreshments & Taiwanese milk tea at 8:45 AM)
Location:  Paul G. Allen Building Extension/CIS-X. Room 101X Cypress Auditorium

Abstract:
As NAND Flash faces challenges in continuing its rapid scaling, resistive switching random access memory (RRAM) has attracted significant attention due to its strong potential as next generation memory devices. A number of high-capacity RRAM chips have been demonstrated recently, showing the potential use of RRAM for solid-state storage applications. Although RRAM has outperformed NAND Flash in many specs at the singe-device level, it is necessary to come up with a technology path towards 3D integration for future mass storage.

In the first part of the presentation, a comprehensive investigation of a novel multi-layer stacked 3D vertical RRAM array will be discussed, including: (1) memory array architecture without selection devices; (2) device fabrication and characterization; (3) demonstration of array operation; (4) study of vertical and horizontal scaling limits; (5) array write-operation robustness; (6) 3D vertical RRAM array analysis and optimization guidelines. Results obtained from both simulations and experiments illustrate the benefits and feasibility of a 3D multi-layer stacked vertical RRAM array.

In the second part of the presentation, I will present the exploration of future memory devices with the use of carbon-based nanomaterials in resistive switching memories. First, I will introduce an electrode/oxide interface engineering technique using single-layer Graphene (SLG), which can raise the low-resistance state (LRS) by 100 times and offer an alternative method to study switching mechanisms in RRAM. Next, laser scribing is an attractive graphene growth and pattering technology because the process is low-cost, time-efficient, transfer-free and flexible. I will present the first demonstration of a resistive-switching memory component enabled by the laser scribing technology. Finally, I will briefly discuss the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for emerging memory applications.

Abstract:

Bio:
My main research interest lies in host-pathogen interactions, particularly the fascinating patterns of co-evolution that hosts and viruses display. In my Ph.D. studis in Tel-Aviv University (Prof. Tal Pupko) I focused on developing novel evolutionary models and methodologies, and used these models to study the interactions between HIV and the human host.

In my post-doctoral studies in lab of Dr. Rotem Sorek (Weizmann Institute) I studied the interaction between phages (bacterial viruses) and the recently discovered CRISPR system, an adaptive immune system in prokaryotes.

Currently my research interests revolve round trying to understand what governs the evolution of RNA viruses and its interactions with the host. I am combining phylogenetics, populations genetics, and experiments, to study:

-The effect of recombination and convergent evolution on viral populations
-Mutational robustness in RNA viruses
-The structure of viral populations and how they evolve
-Discovering novel antiviral systems

Title: Decision Making and Inference Under Limited Information and Large Dimensionality
Spaker: Stefano Ermon, Computer Science, Cornell University
Date: Wednesday, April 9, 2014
Time: 3:00pm-4:00pm
Location: Gates 104

Abstract:
Statistical inference in high-dimensional probabilistic models (i.e., with many variables) is one of the central problems of statistical machine learning and stochastic decision making. To date, only a handful of distinct methods have been developed, most notably (MCMC) sampling, decomposition, and variational methods. In this talk, I will introduce a fundamentally new approach based on random projections and combinatorial optimization. Our approach provides provable guarantees on accuracy, and outperforms traditional methods in a range of domains, in particular those involving combinations of probabilistic and causal dependencies (such as those coming from physical laws) among the variables. This allows for a tighter integration between inductive and deductive reasoning, and offers a range of new modeling opportunities. As an example, I will discuss an application in the emerging field of Computational Sustainability aimed at discovering new fuel-cell materials where we greatly improved the quality of the results by incorporating prior background knowledge of the physics of the system into the model.

Two seminars.

1) Prof. Thomas Chen, Mathematics, University of Texas at Austin
    
Abstract:
This talk surveys some recent results related to the derivation of the cubic nonlinear Schroedinger equation in R^3, and the related Cauchy problem for Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) hierarchies. Moreover, a new approach to the analysis of GP hierarchies using the quantum de Finetti theorem is presented, based on which we obtain a new proof of unconditional uniqueness of solutions, as well as a proof of scattering in the defocusing case (joint work with C. Hainzl, N. Pavlovic and R. Seiringer).

Title: Augmented Reality at the America's Cup, the Technology Behind AC LiveLine - Augmented Reality in Broadcast Sports, from the Hockey Puck, to the Yellow First Down Line, to the America's Cup
Speaker: Stan Honey, America's Cup Event Authority
Date: Wednesday, April 9, 2014
Time: 4:15 pm - 5:30 pm
Location: Gates B01

Abstract:
Augmented reality was first used in live broadcast sports with the Fox Trax highlighted hockey puck introduced at the Hockey All-Star Game in 1996. Far more popular was the Yellow First Down Line which was introduced in 1998 and is now ubiquitous on broadcast football. AC LiveLine is the latest use of augmented reality to enhance the live broadcast of sport but is a significant development beyond prior systems because the video to be augmented is all taken from a helicopter mounted camera which introduces significant challenges.

The technology will be described that was developed to track the America's Cup catamarans to within 2cm, 5 times per second, and superimpose graphics elements such as ahead-behind lines and laylines on the live helicopter footage of the race. Previous America's Cup broadcasts have only featured graphics visible in an animated view of the race. The LiveLine graphics package was designed to help viewers follow the intense action of the AC72s as they flew around the race course on foils, all in live action.

In addition to use for broadcast, this tracking system was used by the America's Cup Race Management team to revolutionize the on the water management of the sport. With the ability to track the America's Cup catamarans within two-centimeters on the race course, event organizers quickly saw the opportunity to leverage the system for on-the-water management of the sport. Telemetering of the course allowed for rapid movement of marks and controlling course limits, while use of real-time overlap and zone-entry determinations enabled umpires to make the most accurate umpiring decisions ever possible in sailing.

The technical and operational developments that lead to LiveLine graphics system and the related race management and electronic umpiring systems will be described along with the problems and pitfalls.

Bio:
Bay Area resident Stan Honey (USA), a three-time Emmy Winner for Technical Innovations in Sports TV Broadcast, the Rolex Yachtsman of the Year for 2010, member of the National Sailing Hall of Fame, and inventor on 29 patents in navigation and graphics, was Director of Technology for the 34th America's Cup by the America's Cup Event Authority (ACEA).

A major figure in technological innovation in sports television, Honey lead the development of the Fox-Trax hockey puck system in 1996 which was the first use of augmented reality in live sports broadcasts. Honey co-founded Sportvision in 1998, where he led the development of the yellow first-down line widely used in the broadcast of American football, the ESPN K-Zone baseball pitch tracking and highlighting system, and the Race/FX tracking and highlighting system used in NASCAR. Honey also is recognized as one of the most successful professional navigators in sailing, having navigated ABN AMRO to victory in the 2005-2006 Volvo Ocean Race (around the world) and having navigated Groupama 3 in setting the Jules Verne record for the fastest circumnavigation of the world under sail in 2010.

Prior to co-founding Sportvision in 1998, Stan Honey worked as Executive VP Technology for News Corporation from 1993 through 1998. Honey co-founded ETAK Inc., the company that pioneered vehicle navigation systems, in 1983, which was sold to News Corporation in 1989 and is now part of TomTom. Prior to founding ETAK, Honey worked as a Research Engineer at SRI International while Honey completed his Stanford MSEE. Honey's earned his BS at Yale in 1978.

Abstract:
Very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic waves are generated by man-made transmitters, lightning discharges and other natural phenomena. These signals can be used to study the earth's ionosphere, magnetosphere and electrical environment. Due to the unique nature of these signals, specialized VLF receiver hardware is required to receive them.

In this talk we present the first single-chip broadband VLF magnetic field receiver. The receiver employs a low-noise amplifier and a continuous-time delta-sigma modulator to achieve a sensitivity of under 1 fT/sqrt(Hz) and a spurious-free dynamic range of over 90 dB. This talk covers the receiver architecture, circuit implementation, lab measurement results and field test results. The single-chip receiver is also compared with the existing VLF receiver deployed by the Stanford VLF research group.

Bio:
Donald Knuth's parents were Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning. Donald's father Ervin was a school teacher who taught in a Lutheran school. He played a very important role in determining Donald's interests, and it was through his father that that Donald gained his love for education, music, and mathematics. Ervin played the church organ at the Sunday church services and Donald soon became a passionate lover of the organ.

Donald attended Lutheran schools and from the special emphasis that was placed on English grammar in these schools came Knuth's love of investigating sentence structure. His fascination with this in his first couple of years of secondary school would lead naturally towards writing computer code when he eventually encountered computers, but this did not happen until after his school education was complete. During these first years at secondary school there were other signs of where Knuth's interests would eventually lead. One episode, repeated in most biographies of Knuth but still worth repeating in this one, concerns "Ziegler's Giant Bar."

He entered a competition set up by the confectionary manufacturer Ziegler. The aim was to see how many words could be made with the letters of "Ziegler's Giant Bar" and for the schoolboy Knuth this was exactly the sort of challenge that he loved. He spent two weeks during which he pretended to be ill and, using a dictionary, he came up with 4500 words. The judges for the competition had only found 2500 and Knuth was an easy winner. He commented afterwards that had he thought to use the apostrophe he could have found many more! His school benefited by receiving a television set as a prize.

At high school Knuth's interests were more directed towards music than they were to mathematics. His musical interests involved both playing and composing music and he decided at that stage that he would study music after graduating from high school. Knuth played the saxophone, and later the tuba, in his school band. Although he spent much time with his musical interests, Knuth most certainly did not neglect his other school subjects. He graduated from High School in 1956 with the highest grade point average that anyone had ever achieved at his school.

At school he had begun to show an interest in mathematics and he amused himself by trying to visualise surfaces in several dimensions by plotting the graphs obtained by keeping all but one of the variables fixed. This is an excellent way to understand mathematical functions and today with the aid of computers this, and more sophisticated techniques, can quickly give students a deep understanding. However Knuth had to plot his graphs by doing hand calculations for every value which he plotted, showing the same sort of dedication to putting hours of work into problems that he had shown with the "Ziegler's Giant Bar" competition. One might have thought that his teachers would have believed that he could succeed at college in almost any subject he chose given his outstanding school performance, but this was not really so. The problem was that Knuth did not believe in himself at this stage in his life and so his teachers doubted whether he had the personality, in particular the confidence, to succeed.

It shows how undecided Knuth was about the direction his studies might take that when offered a scholarship to Case Institute of Technology in Cleveland, Ohio, to study physics he accepted despite his previous intentions to study music. He entered the physics course at the Case Institute in September 1956. There were really two reasons why, from his second year on, Knuth started to move towards mathematics and away from physics. One day when Knuth was meant to be performing with the College band he missed the bus taking the band to the performance so, finding himself with free time, he tried to solve a challenge problem that one of his mathematics professors had set. Solving it earned Knuth an automatic "A" in that class and also the right sort of boost he needed to think that perhaps mathematics rather than physics was for him. Secondly he found that physics practicals did not suit him, so in the end the move towards mathematics became a natural one to make.

In fact Knuth already had his first encounter with computers in his first year at Case before he made the move towards mathematics. He had to use the IBM 650 and consulted the manual to find out how to write programs [1]:-

    ... the manual we got from IBM would show examples of programs and I knew I could do ... better than that. So I thought I might have some talent. 

Knuth used his growing expertise at writing computer programs to produce one in 1958 to analyse the performance of the College basketball team. It led to some publicity and IBM used a photograph of Knuth in their advertising. One might have expected that events would begin to help him overcome his inferiority complex but he still felt that he was not up to standard. This had the effect of making him put in large amounts of extra work at his academic studies. The result was that when he graduated with his B.S. in June 1960 he was awarded a distinction and, in a quite unique move, the College awarded him a Master's Degree at the same time, such was the brilliance of his performance. Knuth was awarded two Fellowships, a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and a National Foundation Fellowship in the year of his graduation.

It is a real achievement to publish a mathematics paper while still a doctoral student, but Knuth managed to publish two papers in the year he completed his undergraduate degree. These were An imaginary number system and On methods of constructing sets of mutually orthogonal Latin squares using a computer I the latter paper being written jointly with R C Bose and I M Chakravarti. In the first Knuth describes an imaginary number system using the imaginary number 2i as its base, giving methods for the addition, subtraction and multiplication of the numbers. In the second paper Knuth and his co-authors give two sets of five mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order 12.

In the autumn of 1960 Knuth entered the California Institute of Technology and, in June 1963, he was awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics for his thesis Finite semifields and projective planes. In fact in addition to the work for his doctorate in mathematics, Knuth had from 1960 begun to put his very considerable computing expertise to uses other than writing papers becoming a software development consultant to the Burroughs Corporation in Pasadena, California. Knowledge of his computing expertise was so well established by 1962 that, although he was still a doctoral student at the time, Addison-Wesley approached him and asked him to write a text on compilers. He began that project in the summer of 1962.

His publications from this time show that he was applying computing to combinatorial mathematical problems which were not connected to the work he was undertaking for his thesis. For example he computed Euler's constant to 1271 decimal places and published the result in 1962. In the same year he published work on the evaluation of polynomials by computer. Despite Knuth's remarkable mathematical productivity he did find time for other things. During his years as a graduate student Knuth married Nancy Jill Carter on 24 June 1961. Their two children John Martin Knuth and Jennifer Sierra Knuth were born in 1965 and 1966 respectively.

We noted above that the title of Knuth's Ph.D. thesis was Finite semifields and projective planes. A semifield is an algebraic structure satisfying all the usual axioms for a division ring except associativity of multiplication. The thesis contains a wealth of information on finite semifields and their connections to certain types of projective planes. After completion of his doctorate in 1963 Knuth became an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology, being promoted to Associate Professor i

Abstract:
Although all cells in our body contain the same genetic material, they can perform vastly different functions by selectively expressing subsets of their genes. Cell-type-specific gene regulation is achieved through interactions between regulatory proteins and epigenetic mechanisms, which affect the structural organization of the genome. Characterizing these interactions is important for understanding the causes of genetic diseases and for identifying potential targets for intervention.

Through computational analysis of changes in epigenetic state across genomic contexts and individuals, we were able to demonstrate that the effects of epigenetic variation on gene regulation are highly combinatorial. Motivated by these results, we developed a machine learning framework for discovering cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms. Our method integrates several data sources including gene expression, DNA sequence information, cell-type-specific epigenetic state, and information regarding protein interactions. Using large-scale datasets from the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE Projects, we reconstructed the regulatory programs of a large number of human cell types. Our model achieves high predictive power and discovers novel cell-type-specific regulatory features and context-specific interactions between them.

What are the secrets of building services customers love? How can designers create products compelling enough to "hook" users? 

Nir Eyal, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products, has constructed a practical framework for designing better products. The framework gives product managers, designers, and marketers a new way for thinking of the necessary components of changing user behavior. Nir will share the tactics companies like Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, Whatsapp, and Twitter use to drive engagement.

Habit design is a super power. If used for good, habit design can enhance people’s lives with entertaining and even healthful routines. If used for evil, habits can quickly turn into wasteful addictions.

Companies need to know how to harness the power of hooks to improve peoples’ lives. At this PARC Forum, attendees will learn:

- The common design patterns of habit-forming products.

- The stages of habit formation and how to optimize for user retention.

- An in-depth look at the psychology behind what drives user behavior and how to build products to cater to core human needs. 

- Practical steps for leading a habit design process to ensure your product is used regularly.

You are warmly invited to the Spring Quarter Seminars of the Stanford Data Science Initiative.  This new initiative is focused on core data technologies with strong ties to application areas across campus. These seminars will help to launch this initiative by bringing together Stanford researchers interested in data science and its applications. The goal of these meetings will be to identify problems of common interest, possible collaborations, and potential funding opportunities. Drinks and snacks will be provided.

Bio:
Balasubramanian Narasimhan:
I was born in India and studied mathematics at Loyola College in Madras,  applied mathematics at P.S.G. College of Technology in Coimbatore.  I obtained my doctorate in Statistics in the Department of Statistics at Florida State University under George Marsaglia.  I taught at University of Minnesota, Morris and Penn State University, Erie, before moving to Stanford University where I hold a joint appointment both in the Department of Statistics and Department of Health Research and Policy.

I met my wife, Kathryn, as a graduate student at Florida State. We have two daughters, Jaya and Sashi.

My main hobbies are music, tennis, and reading. I love classical music (both western and Indian) and I take piano lessons. I am very interested in Indian history and personalities in Indian history. (Oh! I get irrational when discussing Seminole football.)

Prof. Russ Altman: 
Dr. Altman's primary interests are in the application of computing technologies to basic molecular biological problems, now referred to as bioinformatics. He is particularly interested in the analysis of protein and RNA structure and function, both in an individual problem-centered manner and on a functional genomic scale. He has an interest in applying systems biology concepts to pharmacology and personalized medicine. His core initial work was the development of probabilistic algorithms for the determination of protein structure from sparse and uncertain experimental data. These algorithms have been shown to have some advantages over other methods of structure determination including the ability to calculate not only a protein conformation, but also an explicit estimate of the uncertainty in the position of each atom. His current efforts are in three areas. First, he is interested in techniques for representing biological knowledge (not just data) for automatic scientific computation. His group is working on representing the contents of the scientific literature for pharmacogenomics (http://www.pharmgkb.org/) in order to support the task of building robust models of biological systems. As part of this work, the group is also interested in novel user interfaces to biological data, and computational architectures for knowledge environments. Second, he is interested in the analysis of microenvironments within macromolecules. In particular, his group is developing methods for statistically analyzing related structures to infer the key conserved features that distinguish these structures from unrelated structures. This work has implications for the recognition of functional sites in proteins, for protein engineering, and for drug design (http://feature.stanford.edu/). Finally, he is interested in physics-based simulation of biological structures, particularly RNA and proteins. Within this broad area, our focus has been on creating coarse-grain representations of RNA, and on combining machine learning and informatics methods with simulation to maximize the performance of each (http://simbios.stanford.edu/).

Bio:
A scientist and business professional, Euan’s commitment to innovation has enabled him to play pioneering roles with a series of breakthrough technologies. Prior to joining Khosla Ventures, Euan had more than 14 years of experience as a CEO, managing both private and public companies.

Trained as a physicist at the University of London, Euan devoted more than fifteen years to research, teaching, clinical practice, and administration within the United Kingdom health care system. In parallel, Euan formed a successful consultancy practice, providing advice for companies and hospitals on scientific development, product marketing, and management. Serving premier clients such as Varian Medical Systems and Radionics, Inc., he cultivated a specialty in development, positioning, regulatory approvals, pricing, and reimbursement of U.S. products for international markets.

In 2002, Euan joined Accuray Inc., then a small, privately-held company. Directing the company’s evolution from its latent promise to a global company, he applied his foundation of science and technological expertise to secure worldwide clinical acceptance for CyberKnife® Radiosurgery through the creation of protocols and studies for treatment of tumors in the brain, spine, lung, liver, pancreas, prostate and breast; and improved Accuray’s intellectual property portfolio from five issued U.S. patents in FY 2001 to 290 issued U.S. and Foreign patents by the end of 2012. Expanding both the reach and scope of the organization, Euan built distribution channels in more than 80 countries; he executed a strategic sales alliance with Siemens Healthcare and consummated the successful acquisition of TomoTherapy®, Inc. in 2011. Both at Accuray and his prior company, Photoelectron Inc, Euan initiated and directed a host of sophisticated financial transactions including private and public investments and Initial Public Offerings. The successful 2007 Accuray IPO was priced above range, and approximately 10x oversubscribed. Applying considerable business acumen to his role at Accuray, he has oversaw exponential revenue growth from $10 million in 2002 to more than $400 million in fiscal year 2012.

Euan is a member of the Board of Directors of the Hospice of the Valley, a hospice facility serving individuals with life-limiting illnesses. Euan has served as Chair of the California Division of the American Cancer Society’s CEO’s Against Cancer. He is the recipient of an Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year award (N. California, Health & Life Sciences), and an ABBY Award from the Adaptive Business Leaders Organization for his innovation in biotechnology. Having earned a B.S. in Physics, an M.S. in Radiation Physics, and a Ph.D. in Physics, Euan is the author of numerous scientific papers and personally holds six U.S. patents.

Title: Pixels or Coordinates? Computation Methods in Super-resolution Microscopy
Speaker: Prof. Bo Huang, Pharmaceutical Chemistry, UCSF
Organizer: Prof. Ron Dror, Computer Science, Stanford University
Date: Monday, April 14, 2014
Time: 4:15pm-5:15pm
Location: Y2E2-111

In spring quarter the ICME Colloquium and LA/Opt seminars will be combined and will be on Mondays at 4:15pm in Stanford's Math Corner.
 
Ron Dror is organizing seminars around a computational biology theme.

Abstract:
In super-resolution microscopy methods based on single-molecule switching (STORM/PALM), each camera frame samples a random, sparse subset of probe molecules in the samples. The final super-resolution image is assembled with the molecule coordinates extracted from thousands of frames. We have developed a sparse-signal recovery technique using compressed sensing to analyze camera images with highly overlapping fluorescent spots. This method allows one camera image to sample an order of magnitude more fluorophores, thus improving the temporal resolution of live imaging. In order to increase the total duration of observation limited by fluorophore photobleaching, we utilized the redundant information from adjacent snapshots in a time sequence. With a deformable registration algorithm, we have effectively reduced the number of camera frames required for super-resolution image reconstruction. Finally, we developed a framework for correlation analysis of coordinate-based super-resolution images. We have shown a variety of applications of this framework, including image alignment, single-molecule tracking and the quantification of colocalization.

Title: NSA Surveillance and What To Do About It
Speaker: Bruce Schneier, Fellow, Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Harvard Law School
Date: Tuesday, April 15, 2014
Time: 5:00pm-7:00pm
Location: Stanford Law School - Room 280B, 559 Nathan Abbott Way, Stanford, CA 

RSVP is required for this free event. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hDQ4W0haF5_iBZ1fIHuhWkT8-YWPNbegCTEQuzEVSYg/viewform

5:00pm Reception - Manning Faculty Lounge
6:00pm Talk Begins - Room 290

Abstract:
Edward Snowden has given us an unprecedented window into the NSA's surveillance activities. Drawing from both the Snowden documents and revelations from previous whistleblowers, this talk describes the sorts of surveillance the NSA conducts and how it conducts it. The emphasis will be on the technical capabilities of the NSA, and not the politics or legality of their actions. I will then discuss what sorts of countermeasures are likely to frustrate any nation-state adversary with these sorts of capabilities. These will be techniques to raise the cost of wholesale surveillance in favor of targeted surveillance: ubiquitous encryption, target dispersal, anonymity tools, and so on.

Bio:
Dr. Pepperell's research focuses on the ecology and evolution of human pathogens. Infectious diseases differ from other human diseases in that they involve the interplay between distinct species with mostly antagonistic goals. Many of the techniques developed in the field of evolutionary biology are well suited to the study of these dynamic systems and are promising tools in the search for improved methods to control and treat infectious diseases.

                            EE380 Computer Systems Colloquium
Title: Insights into The Nature of Time in Physics, and Implications for Computer Science
Speaker: Paul Borrill, Founder and CEO, EARTH Computing, Inc.
Date: Wednesday, April 16, 2014
Time: 4:15 pm - 5:30 pm
Location: Gates B03

Abstract:
The concept of time is a well recognized enigma in physics. According to the great physicist John Archibald Wheeler: Beyond all day-to-day problems in physics, in the profound issues of principle that confront us today, no difficulties are more central than those associated with the concept of time. In computer science, we tend to sweep these issues under the rug, and rely on an overly-simplistic concept of linear time that implicitly includes notions such as simultaneity and irreversibility, which are known to be incorrect in our two most successful physical theories: Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Part One of this lecture reviews the current state of our understanding of time from physics. Part Two highlights the implicit assumptions we so often use in computer science, and their possible implications on the correctness, reliability and performance of our systems. Part Three introduces a recently published conjecture on the relationship between information, entanglement and time, as a vehicle to both challenge the way we think about time when we design our algorithms and develop our models of computations. We hope to stimulate new ways of thinking that advance computer science down richer and perhaps more innovative paths.

Bio:
Cathy Ball leads a group of Population Geneticists, Statisticians, and Computer Scientists to create the analytical approaches behind the AncestryDNA direct-to-consumer genotyping services. Cathy is a genomic scientist who has annotated and mined the genomes of various organisms and created resources to help other scientists exploit and explore genome data. She has collaborated on the annotation of the first eukaryotic genome (brewer's yeast) and has collaboratively built databases to explore the genomes of yeast, E. coli and the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. As a pioneer in data analysis resources for high-throughput biomedical technologies, she led the Stanford Microarray Database, the largest academic database of its kind. Cathy has used high-throughput biomedical data to shed light on diverse research topics, from the biology of infectious organisms to the mechanisms involved in cell division and cancer. She received a B.S. in Biology and a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the University of California, Los Angeles. She was a post-doctoral fellow at the University of California, Berkeley prior to her research in the Departments of Genetics and Biochemistry at Stanford University School of Medicine.

Title: Email Encryption: Pretty Good Privacy Even when Someone's Listening
Speaker: Tom Lowenthal, Technologist, Activist
Date: Tuesday, April 22, 2014 
Time: 5:30pm-7:00pm
Location: Stanford Law School - Room 280B, 559 Nathan Abbott Way, Stanford, CA 

RSVP is required for this free event. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zdYRxUwpqYKDnChMad-C-VrI1iXf1EnASGZ3zMDiHgY/viewform

Reception - 5:30pm
Workshop - 6:00pm

Abstract:
Pretty-good-privacy or PGP is the world's most widely-used email encryption system, capable of protecting the contents of messages from interception by anyone from an ISP to the NSA. In this workshop Tom Lowenthal will introduce us to PGP, explain how to use it and teach us some of its foibles. Audience members are encouraged to bring their laptops: the session will be hands on, and you should walk away with the software installed and configured. Folks of any technical experience level are welcome at this session. There's plenty to cover, and the material will be tailored to the level of the room.

Bio:
Tom Lowenthal is a technologist and an activist who specializes in operational security and grassroots surveillance self-defense. A year ago, his opinions on computer security sounded over-the-top, but now they barely seem adequate. He believes strongly in individual privacy & personal freedom and tries to avoid making eye contact with security cameras., which doesn't work nearly as well as it sounds. Tom works to improve the state of usable liberations technologies and teach at-risk users about the steps they can take to be safe. He previously worked as a paranoia advocate at Mozilla, and the Tor Project's coordinator. He holds a B.A. in Political Theory with Computer Science and Technology Policy from Princeton University. You can harangue him on Twitter @flamsmark, or find other contact info at tomlowenthal.com.

Title: The Genetic Basis of Phenotypic Adaptation: Adaptation to a Moving Optimum
Speaker: Prof. Joachim Hermisson, Mathematics, University of Vienna
Host: Prof. Dmitri Petrov, Biology, Stanford University 
Date: Wednesday, April 23, 2014
Time: 1:15pm-2:15pm (Lunch at 1:00pm)
Location: Clark Center S360

Abstract:
TBA

Bio:
Joachim studied Physics and Philosophy in Tübingen and Göttingen and did a PhD on Quantum Phase Transitions before he switched to model Real Life. He worked with Günter Wagner at Yale and started his own group in Munich in 2002 with the help of an Emmy Noether research grant by the German Research Foundation (DFG). In October 2007, he started his position as a Professor of Mathematics and Biosciences at the University of Vienna.

Joachim's work is on theoretical population genetics where he combines molecular and phenotypic approaches. He is particularly interested in the evolutionary conditions for adaptation and speciation. Recent projects range from the evolution of assortative mating under frequency-dependent disruptive selection to the study of selective sweeps and the footprint of selection in molecular adaptation. A special research focus is on the effects of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions on genetic variation and the adaptive process (epistatis and evolvability) and on the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map (robustness, canalization, and modularity).

Bio:
I recently completed my PhD at the Theory Group of the MIT Computer Science Department where I was advised by Jonathan Kelner, Muriel Médard and David Karger.

I am currently a postdoc at Microsoft Research Silicon Valley and in 2014 I will join the faculty of the Department of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

Before I came to MIT I spent a year visiting the Theory Group of the Princeton University Computer Science Department where I worked with Robert E. Tarjan. I did my undergraduate studies at the Technical University Munich in Germany where I studied Mathematics and was a fellow of TopMath. I graduated with a Diplom in Mathematics, the TopMath Bachelor of Science and the TopMath Master of Science with Honours.

Abstract:
Electrostatic forces and the electrostatic properties of molecules in solution are among the most important issues in understanding the structure and function of large biomolecules. The use of implicit-solvent models, such as the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE), have been used with great success as a way of computationally deriving electrostatics properties such molecules. We discuss how to solve an elliptic system of partial differential equations (PDEs) involving the Poisson and the PBEs using path-integral based probabilistic, Feynman-Kac, representations. This leads to a Monte Carlo method for the solution of this system which is specified with a stochastic process, and a score function. We use several techniques to simplify the Monte Carlo method and the stochastic process used in the simulation, such as the walk-on-spheres (WOS) algorithm, and an auxiliary sphere technique to handle internal boundary conditions. We then specify some optimizations using the error (bias) and variance to balance the CPU time. We show that our approach is as accurate as widely used deterministic codes, but has many desirable properties that these methods do not. In addition, the currently optimized codes consume comparable CPU times to the widely used deterministic codes. Thus, we have an very clear example where a Monte Carlo calculation of a low-dimensional PDE is as fast or faster than deterministic techniques at similar accuracy levels.

Bio:
Michael Mascagni was born in Bologna, Italy of one American and one Italian parent.  However, by the age of four he was in the US confusing his Lake Forest, Illinois kindergarten teacher (and American grandmother) by correctly answering her Italian.  This confusion continued though High School in Clinton, Iowa and College at the University of Iowa.  At Iowa, he obtained a B.S.E. in Biomedical Engineering, and a B.S. in Mathematics and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi, the top liberal arts and engineering academic honor societies.

After graduation, he seriously considered going to Medical School, and declined two such offers to instead study Neurobiology at the Rockefeller University, which is located on the East River the middle of Manhattan.  Since "the Rock" is such a small and specialized University, he also took graduate classes uptown, at Columbia University, and downtown, at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University.  Eventually, downtown trumped midtown and uptown, and Mathematics trumped Neurobiology, and he obtained his M.S. and Ph.D. in Mathematics from Courant.  Perhaps more importantly, his social contacts at "the Rock" introduced him to his future wife, Becky Fandrei, at a party during an historic snow storm in New York.  They were married between the Masters and Doctoral degrees.

Upon graduation, he obtained a post-doctoral research position in the Mathematical Research Branch of an institute of the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, MD and they moved to Washington, DC.  It was during this period his research moved away from modeling the nervous system to studying the high-performance computing implications of the algorithms he developed and used.  He was one of the first to use random number-based algorithms on the massively parallel Connection Machine at the Naval Research Lab in DC.  In fact, after two years at NIH he moved to the Institute for Defense Analyses' Supercomputing Research Center in Bowie, MD.  This organization works for the National Security Agency, and it was here that his interests in parallel computing, random number generation, number theory, and discrete mathematics were nurtured.  During his time at SRC his oldest sons Alexander and Marcus were born, and are now both Eagle Scouts.

After many happy years at SRC, he decided to rejoin academia, and went to the University of Southern Mississippi to run the Graduate Program in Scientific Computing.  After a few years there, a desire to join a Computer Science department arose, and he moved to Florida State University as an Associate Professor of Computer Science, he has since been promoted to Full Professor.  While at FSU his youngest son, Evan, was born.  At FSU he also has appointments as Professor of Mathematics, Professor of Scientific Computing, and a faculty member of the Graduate Program in Molecular Biophysics.

Dr. Mascagni is on the editorial board of three journals in his field, and is a member of the ACM (Association of Computing Machinery), SIAM (Society of Applied Mathematics), the Swiss Speedup Society and IMACS (International Association of Mathematics and Computers in Simulation).  He is also an ACM Distinguished Scientist and a member of the Board of Directors of IMACS.  He has approximately 130 refereed technical papers that have appeared in a wide variety of publications in areas including Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, Simulation Science, Monte Carlo Methods, Computational Science, High-Performance Computing, Scientific Computing, Computational Physics, and Computational Neuroscience.  He has been a visiting professor at the University of Padova in Italy, the University of Salzburg in Austria, the University of the South-Toulon and Var in France, and the Swiss Federal Technical Institute-Zürich in Switzerland, and is a consultant to industries and governments across the globe.  He has made technical presentations in 25 countries and in most of the 50 U.S. states.  Most recently he has been made a Faculty Appointee at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Maryland.

The areas of research that Dr. Mascagni's research team work on are parallel and distributed computing, Grid computing, Cloud computing, random number generation, Monte Carlo methods, computational number theory and discrete algorithms, and applications to materials science, biochemistry, electrostatics, and finance.

His hobbies include swimming and biking, which arise from his misspent youth at NYU where he commuted by bicycle and swam each day, and playing the violin.  In fact, he has been the concertmaster of the Big Bend Community Orchestra in Tallahassee and on its Board of Directors, and even its President and he has played with several orchestras in places like Washington, DC, Salzburg, Austria and Zürich, Switzerland. He is now also the President of The Artist Series, which presents professional chamber music concerts to appreciative audiences in the Florida Big Bend, and is first violin in Beethoven's Revenge, a string quartet.  He has also been an active adult leader in Troop 118 in Tallahassee, and Troop 684 in Zürich, Switzerland, and has been to the International Scout Centre in Kandersteg, Switzerland, and all of the North American BSA High Adventure Bases on challenging treks involving backpacking, canoeing, sailing, and snorkeling.

Abstract:
In this talk, EFF's Technology Projects Director Peter Eckersley will survey they state of Internet security and surveillance in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations. It is unlikely that we can protect most Internet users against sophisticated, targeted attacks by their own and other governments, but there is more reason to be optimistic that we might shield the bulk of users' data against the type of dragnet surveillance that the US and other governments are conducting.

Peter will discuss the things that individual users can currently do to achieve stronger communications security; the (often very subtle) technical aspects to deploying HTTPS/TLS/SSL securely on the server side; some of the important places where our existing protocols are letting us down from a security and privacy perspective; the terrible dynamics of cross border-surveillance; and what we could do to change all of this.

Bio:
Peter Eckersley is Technology Projects Director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. He keeps his eyes peeled for technologies that, by accident or design, pose a risk to computer users' freedoms—and then looks for ways to fix them. He explains gadgets to lawyers, and lawyers to gadgets. Peter's work at EFF has included privacy and security projects such as Panopticlick, HTTPS Everywhere, SSDI, and the SSL Observatory; helping to launch a movement for open wireless networks; fighting to keep modern computing platforms open; and running the first controlled tests to confirm that Comcast was using forged reset packets to interfere with P2P protocols.

Peter holds a PhD in computer science and law from the University of Melbourne; his research focused on the practicality and desirability of using alternative compensation systems to legalize P2P file sharing and similar distribution tools while still paying authors and artists for their work. He is an affiliate of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.

Bio:
Ben Wilson is a Graduate Student in Petrov Lab (2010-now). He received his B.S. from the University of Arizona where he worked with Joanna Mazel. Ben is interested in the theoretical population genetics of adaptation, particularly in populations that fluctuate in size over various time-scales. He is also interested in how complex adaptive landscapes contribute to the evolutionary trajectories we see in adaptation. Ben uses a combination of theoretical approaches with experimental evolution and genomic inference to test theoretical predictions.

Bio:
Dane Glasgow serves as vice president, global product management for eBay Marketplaces, and brings more than 15 years of experience leading product design and development, innovation in search technology, and management to the world’s largest online marketplace. In his role, Dane focuses on delivering a compelling shopping experience globally for both buyers and sellers – from eBay’s homepage and search experience, to tailored verticals in the Fashion and Electronics categories, to an end-to-end selling experience. Working closely with eBay’s North American and European business teams, Dane and his worldwide team of product managers, designers, and data managers aim to surface the best deals, drive increased business conversion and grow customer satisfaction across more than 94 million active users and $62 billion in gross merchandize volume globally (2010). In December 2010, Dane helped lead eBay’s acquisition of Milo, a local shopping engine, and now manages the integration of Milo’s local commerce solution into the eBay customer experience.

Dane previously served as eBay’s vice president of engineering, where his team brought an increased level of structure and depth to the eBay Global Product Catalog, an ever-growing master resource of structured data to categorize and manage eBay’s vast selection of inventory.

Dane joined eBay in December of 2008 through the acquisition of Positronic, a company he co-founded in Seattle. Positronic developed a sophisticated machine learning and natural language processing platform in the finance sector. As Positronic’s chief technology officer, Dane set the software vision – driving the architecture and roadmap to achieve positive results. Positronic’s technology and team were integrated into eBay following the acquisition.

Before co-founding Positronic, Dane was the director of program management at Microsoft for the Live Search product, leading a talented team of program managers who were responsible for delivering fast, relevant Search to customers throughout the world. In coordination with the development and test organizations, the team created the Web Search experience for Microsoft through MSN.com, Microsoft.com, and Live.com, including offerings for searching Web pages, Images, News, Products, Videos, and Blogs. All of these integrated experiences were geared toward helping hundreds of millions of customers in nearly 50 different markets worldwide quickly find the information that was most important to them.

Prior to working on Live Search, Dane served as the general manager for the Windows Live Portal & Client team. The group developed software ranging from the Live.com portal, which placed users at the center of their information experience, to the MSN Search Toolbar, which offered significant browsing and search enhancements for Internet Explorer. In this role, Dane delivered near-instant search results for files and email on users' PCs through Windows Desktop Search. Dane also drove the acquisitions of Lookout Software, a provider of fast email searching for Microsoft Outlook, and Onfolio, a company delivering tools for browser-based research and information management. The team went on to ship Windows Live Writer, a desktop blog publishing application.

Previously, he helped launch MS Ideas, an internal site dedicated to helping employees post, discuss, and collaborate on new product ideas and technologies. Dane also served as Group Manager of MSN Calendar - which provided calendaring, task management, and notifications in numerous languages through MSN Hotmail.

Dane joined Microsoft in April 1999 through the acquisition of Jump.com, a company he helped create in Ithaca, N.Y. Jump provided the first completely connected, Internet-based email, calendar and tasks service. Dane served as president of Jump, overseeing product design, technology partnerships, and operations. Prior to Jump, Dane served as vice president, Ithaca Division of Meetinghouse Technologies, a multimedia development company delivering consumer, corporate, and government software and services.

Dane attended Cornell University, where he studied computer science, business, and fine arts. Outside of the office, he enjoys photography, computer graphics, amateur high altitude ballooning/rocketry, robotics, helping educational and scientific-based charities, and driving fast cars. Dane serves on the board of trustees for the SETI Institute, a non-profit scientific organization whose mission is to explore, understand and explain the origin, nature, and prevalence of life in the universe.

Bio:
At PAMF, Dr. Chan is the interface between patients, providers, and technology, leveraging health IT to empower patients and the care team to become better partners in health, and ultimately transform the way healthcare is delivered. He leads a clinical informatics team that focuses on the optimization of use of electronic health records (EHR) and personal health records (EHR) for patient care delivery and clinical operations. Currently, nearly 75% of adult PAMF patients and 50% of family caregivers use My Health Online, both via the web and on mobile devices to view their health information, schedule appointments, and communicate with their doctors and other members of the care team.

As Medical Director of the David Druker Center for Health Systems Innovation, he works with an interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists, ethnographers and software engineers to innovate and cultivate new models of health care delivery. The Druker Center is engaged in two exciting initiatives - EMPOWER-H (Engaging and Motivating Patients Online With Enhanced Resources-for Hypertension), a new care delivery model designed to enhance the care of patients with hypertension, including mobile applications to monitor blood pressure control and linkAgesTM, a functional, coordinated and scalable ecosystem to promote Successful Aging for our seniors and the communities they live in.

Previously, Dr. Chan served as Co-Chair of California Health and Human Services Agency's Patient Engagement Work Group, identifying innovative approaches to engaging and empowering patients and their families through the use of technology that harnesses the HIE infrastructure, and recommend how to incorporate these approaches into the State's HIE services. He was also Co-Chair of the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology (CCHIT) Personal Health Records Work Group, which developed criteria for personal health record software certification.

Dr. Chan earned a bachelor's degree with honors in Biological Sciences from Stanford University and a medical degree from the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. He completed his residency and year as chief resident in family medicine at the San Jose Medical Center Family Practice Residency, affiliated with Stanford University of School of Medicine. Albert concurrently completed a post-doctoral fellowship in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University School of Medicine and Family Medicine Research at the University of California, San Francisco School of Medicine, studying the effects of point of care decision support in the management of hypertension. During fellowship, Dr. Chan also assisted with the launch of PAMFOnline, one of the earliest PHRs in the United States.

Dr. Chan received the "Future Leader" Health Care Hero Award from the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal in May 2012.

Title: Sales Mechanisms in Online Markets: What Happened to Internet Auctions?
Speaker: Prof. Jonathan Levin, Economics, Stanford University
Date: Wednesday, May 14, 2014
Time: 12:00-1:00pm
Location: Y2E2 101

Lunch is provided.

Abstract:
Consumer auctions were very popular in the early days of internet commerce, but today online sellers mostly use posted prices. Compositional shifts in the items being sold and the sellers offering these items cannot account for this evolution. Instead, the returns to sellers using auctions have diminished. We consider two hypotheses: a shift in buyer preferences away from auctions, and an increase in competition or search efficiency that favors favors posted prices. We use a model and data from eBay to tease these apart, finding that the former is more important, especially for more idiosyncratic products. We also discuss why auctions and posted prices can coexist in online markets.

Bio:
After degrees in mathematics and statistics, and time working in industry, Iain Mathieson moved into the field of population genetics for graduate school. He recently completed his DPhil at Oxford under the supervision of Cecilia Lindgren and Gil McVean, and has since started a postdoctoral appointment in David Reich's lab at Harvard. Mathieson's research focuses on developing population genetic based methods for inference which can be efficiently applied to large genomic datasets. In particular, he develops methods to investigate population structure and history, both as interesting quantities in themselves, and as confounding factors in other analyses such as genome-wide association studies. Much of his research has been concerned with rare variants which, now accessible through sequence data, can be highly informative about ancestry and relatedness. Mathieson intends to continue developing these methods and is particularly excited about using them to investigate data from ancient DNA in order to develop a more nuanced picture of recent human history and evolution.

Abstract: 
TBA

Bio:
Dr. Anjan Bose has over thirty-five years of experience in industry and academia, as an engineer, educator and administrator. He is well known as a technical leader in the power grid control industry, a researcher in electric power engineering, an educator in engineering, and an administrator in higher education.

Dr. Bose is a Member of the US National Academy of Engineering and has served on several NAE/NRC Committees. He is a Fellow of the IEEE and is active in several international professional societies.  He was the recipient of the Outstanding Power Engineering Educator Award (1994), the Third Millenium Medal (2000) and the Herman Halperin Electric Transmission & Distribution Award (2006), from the IEEE.  He has been recognized as a distinguished alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (2005) and the College of Engineering at Iowa State University (1993).

At Washington State University, Dr. Bose holds the endowed Distinguished Professorship in Power Engineering, and is the Site Director of the NSF sponsored Power System Engineering Research Center. From 1998 to 2005 he served as the Dean of the College of Engineering and Architecture which has about 150 faculty, 75 staff members, and 2500 students over four campuses. During that period, the college doubled its annual research expenditures and donations while the state and tuition budgets decreased. From 1993 to 1998, he was the Director of the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science which is the largest unit in the college.

Before joining WSU, Dr. Bose was on the faculty of Arizona State University, where he directed the Electric Power Research Laboratory, a cooperative research program (supported by the local power industry) that he helped establish in 1982. In addition, his own research group became internationally known for applying computation technology to the control and analysis of large power grids. In 1988-89, he was on leave from the university to manage the Program on Engineering Systems (Power) at the National Science Foundation.

Before ASU, Dr. Bose worked for Control Data Corporation in their Energy Management Systems Division (now Siemens Energy Management & Information Systems).  He administered a research group of over a dozen professionals and played a crucial role in the technical leadership of the division ($50 million yearly revenue), which became the leading vendor of power system control centers during this time.  Major breakthroughs in power system control technology under his leadership are industrial practice today.  He has continued to be a technical leader in this industry and is a prominent consultant.

He has served on several editorial boards of IEEE publications and the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science & Technology.  He has also served, some as chair, on several international technical committees and conference organizations.  He was appointed by the governor to the board of directors of the Washington Technology Center (served as Vice-Chair for three years), and by the US Secretary of Energy on the committee to study the 1999 and 2003 power blackouts.  He has consulted for many electric power companies and related government agencies throughout the world.

Abstract: 
TBA

Bio:
Currently, I am the VP of Data Technologies for PayPal, where I joined in April, 2012.
Thousands of PayPalians and many systems benefit from the information that flows through our platform today. We strive to add many new, cutting edge capabilities to our platform. Hyper growth, or even slow steady growth over time, present challenges with scaling and sustaining the technology stacks. In most successful enterprises, yesterday’s technology stacks drive today’s businesses. They often do not meet stakeholder’s expectations and limiting further growth. Therefore, the need for building a new and futuristic technology stack is prevalent but the challenge is building such system while supporting/delivering on the current commitments. This not only requires parallel development (leapfrogging the current system in capabilities) but also requires smart migration of the business to the new stacks. Hence, I look to empower our technologists to make the best choices in technology, architecture, and organization for building the new stacks.

Prior to PayPal, I served as the CTO of Shopping.com, where I oversaw all technology platforms, including research, architecture, engineering and operations. I joined Shopping.com in 2008, and came from Yahoo where I served as Vice President of Engineering, Ad Systems. I was responsible for the architecture, development, QA and operations of Yahoo's Graphical Ad Systems. Prior to Yahoo, I was the VP of Engineering at Selectica, where I directed Applications and Operations. Before joining Selectica in 2000, I held a variety of engineering and management positions with Menlo Park, CA-based Informix Software, Inc., including director of Web Technology and Senior Manager of Research and Development.

I hold B.Sc. in Mathematics, Post B.Sc. in Computer Science and Master of Computer Applications. I am also listed as an inventor on several patent applications for Yahoo Corporation related to online advertising and mobile monetization.

Abstract:
TBA

Bio: 
My main fields of interest are the economics of incentives, industrial organization and microeconomics. My research aspires to advance our understanding of the roles played by two central institutions ---firms and contractual agreements---and how these institutions facilitate the creation of value. Within this broader framework, I have focused on a firm's reputation as a valuable, tradeable asset; the effects of contract design and organizational form on firm behavior with applications to outsourcing and privatization; public and private sector procurement and award mechanisms; and the determinants of trust.

Bio:
Philip Labo studied both biology and computer science as an undergraduate at Penn. He received his B.A., in biology, in 2004. During that time he also worked as a programmer/analyst for the Plasmodium falciparum genome database (plasmodb.org). Philip left Penn for Stanford in Fall 2005 to pursue a doctorate in statistics. His doctoral research focused on the modeling of adaptive evolution in certain populations of baker’s yeast. He also studied the modeling of adaptive evolution in general. During the Spring of 2011 he started working with Jamie Jones, of the Stanford Anthropology Department, on the analysis of evolutionary pressures on life history patterns in the Utah Population Database. Philip now works as a post-doctoral scholar with the Prematurity Research Center in the Stanford School of Medicine lending his statistical expertise to the study of preterm birth in United States. Jamie Jones and Paul Wise oversee his work.

Applied Math Seminar

Title: Turbulence and Integrability 
Speaker: Prof. Govind Menon, Applied Mathematics, Brown University
Organizer: Prof. Lenya Ryzhik, Mathematics, Stanford University
Date: Wednesday, May 28, 2014
Time: 4:15pm-5:15pm
Location: 380-380C

Abstract:
Ensembles of solutions to partial differential equations underly mathematical theories of turbulence and phase transitions. However, our understanding of such ensembles for even well-understood PDE is quite modest. For example, there is no satisfactory theory of a soliton gas for NLS or KdV despite a detailed understanding of these PDE that ranges from the classical (explicit N-solitons) to the modern (optimal well-posedness theorems). Perhaps the simplest nonlinear PDE are scalar conservation laws. I will present a fairly complete conceptual picture for the evolution of certain random data by these PDE that has emerged over the past few years. The punchline is that the evolution of the law of the solution is determined by a completely integrable system of kinetic equations that describes the clustering of shocks. This approach allows the introduction of powerful methods from integrable systems, and suggests new lines of attack on related problems.

Bio:
I currently work on the following areas in mathematical physics:

Kinetics of phase transitions and models of domain coarsening.
Integrable systems and random matrix theory.
Statistical theories of turbulence.

The common theme in my work in these areas is the use of integrable systems.The methods of integrable systems bridge several areas of mathematics, linking deep algebraic structure with powerful computational techniques. I am mainly interested in the unexpected appearance of integrable structures in several probabilistic models. I am also interested in the construction of random fields in several applications (in particular, random surfaces and turbulent fluid flows). If you're a beginning or prospective grad student and you don't know what these words mean, here is a rough translation: I prove theorems about ensembles of solutions to various equations of physical importance. My work is roughly at the intersection of dynamical systems, PDE and probability theory.

I am also fascinated with the idea that biology can inspire nanotechnology. I collaborate with several labs on the use of self-assembly to design containers, devices and supramolecular assemblies. Here is a link to a brief documentary explaining part of our work. Interested in a longer explanation? Here is my talk at the Frontiers of Science meeting in 2012. My work on self-assembly involves mainly modeling and scientific computation, but there is certainly interesting mathematical structure to be discovered.

Bio:
StartX Med is a medical vertical of StartX focused on accelerating the development of Stanford's top medical entrepreneurs through experiential education and collective intelligence.

Recognizing that medical start-ups have industry-specific needs not addressed by the typical accelerator, StartX Med was developed by Divya Nag, a StartX alumni who founded Stem Cell Theranostics and her company co-founder, Andrew Lee. The two sought to bring additional resources like wet/dry lab space, animal testing facilities, clean rooms and specialized instruction on med-tech intellectual property and the FDA approval process to medical companies.

Today StartX Med focuses on "Advancing breakthrough healthcare technologies by accelerating the development of Stanford's highest-potential medical entrepreneurs". We do so by focusing on people in order to develop a community and educate our founders in their efforts to transform healthcare. We support founders across the entire innovation life cycle in biotechnology, medical device, health IT, care delivery innovation, imaging & diagnostics.

StartX Med companies apply through the same competitive StartX process and work along side the entrepreneurs in the StartX program.

We take 0% equity from founders.

Abstract:
TBA

Bio:
Mathematical applications to Biology, in particular I am interested in integrating the information provided by phylogenetic trees, community interaction graphs and metabolic networks. We use computational statistics, in particular, nonparametric computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap and MCMC to draw inferences about complex biological phenomena, such as the interactions between the immune system and cancer.
I enjoy teaching using R and bioconductor and web-based tools.

I have collaborations in the medical school doing image analysis, drug resistance in HIV and Microbiome Data Analysis.

My specialty: Mining complex (messy is a better word) biological datasets.
