DESCRIPTION:Speaker: \n\nDepartment: CS\n\nTags: \n\nDescription: Symbolic
  Systems Forum\nTitle: Computing with Natural Language\nSpeaker: Prof. Per
 cy Liang\, Computer Science\, Stanford University\nDate: Monday\, April 7\
 , 2014\nTime: 12:15 pm - 1:05 pm\nLocation: Building 460\, Room 126\n\nAbs
 tract:\nToday\, the tremendous growth of semi-structured data far outpaces
  our ability to ask interesting deep questions of it.  Moreover\, much of 
 the advanced data processing and analysis is limited to the privileged few
  who have programming expertise.  In this talk\, I will entertain the poss
 ibility of using natural language as a universal and agile interface for q
 uerying\, and more generally computing with\, data.  Specifically\, I will
  discuss two recent projects: (i) learning to map natural language questio
 ns into database queries on Freebase\; and (ii) learning to map natural la
 nguage queries onto XPath expressions that extract entities from web pages
 .  In both these projects\, I will discuss the statistical and computation
 al challenges of learning from weakly-supervised data.\n\nBio:\nPercy Lian
 g is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University (B.
 S. from MIT\, 2004\; Ph.D. from UC Berkeley\, 2011). His research focuses 
 on methods for learning richly-structured statistical models from limited 
 supervision\, most recently in the context of semantic parsing in natural 
 language processing. He won a best student paper at the International Conf
 erence on Machine Learning in 2008\, received the NSF\, GAANN\, and NDSEG 
 fellowships\, and is also a 2010 Siebel Scholar.\n************************

  of Antiviral Targets\nSpeaker: Prof. Leor Weinberger\, Biochemistry & Bio
 physics\, UCSF\nOrganizer: Prof. Ron Dror\, Computer Science\, Stanford Un
 iversity\nDate: Monday\, April 7\, 2014\nTime: 4:15pm-5:15pm\nLocation: Y2
 E2\, Room 111\n\nIn spring quarter the ICME Colloquium and LA/Opt seminars
  will be combined and will be on Mondays at 4:15pm in Stanford's Math Corn
 er.\n \nRon Dror is organizing seminars around a computational biology the
 me.\n\nAbstract: \nViral gene circuits are bounded by many of the same des
 ign constraints as electrical circuits (e.g.\, signal-to-noise ratio) but 
 rapidly mutating viruses\, like HIV\, evolved unique mechanisms to circumv
 ent and even exploit these constraints.These adaptations are essential to 
 the evolutionary fitness of viruses and present novel targets for antivira
 l therapy. I will describe two viral circuit adaptations\, the first in HI
 V (see Weinberger & Weinberger\, Cell\, 2013) and the second in the human 
 herpesvirus CMV (Teng et al.\, Cell\, 2012)\, the leading cause of birth d
 efects and transplant rejections. I will show how disrupting and exploitin
 g these circuit architectures presents a new therapy spectrum.\n\nBio:\nDr
 . Weinberger’s primary research focuses on fundamental principles of gen
 e regulation\, and more specifically on the study of regulatory "master ci
 rcuits" that control HIV and human herpes viruses. His laboratory employs 
 a coupled\, computational-experimental approach that relies on quantitativ
 e\, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy with mathematical modeling to study
  viral gene-expression circuits and expression "noise" at the single-cell 
 level.\n\nBefore joining the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunolog
 y and UCSF in 2011\, Dr. Weinberger was an Assistant Professor of Chemistr
 y and Biochemistry at the University of California\, San Diego.\n\nDr. Wei
 nberger is a member of numerous scientific societies and serves on the inn
 ovation review panel for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\, and on th
 e board of advisors for the National Institute for Mathematical and Biolog
 ical Synthesis.\n\nA number of prestigious organizations have recognized D
 r. Weinberger’s innovative research mapping of the architecture of the H
 IV regulatory circuit. Most recently\, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation name
 d Dr. Weinberger a 2011 Sloan Research Fellow. Previous awards include the
  W.M. Keck Foundation Research Award\, the California HIV/AIDS Young Inves
 tigator Innovative Development Award\, a Bill and Melinda Gates Grand Chal
 lenges in Global Health Explorations Award\, an NIH Director’s New Innov
 ator Award and a Pew Scholarship in Biomedical Sciences.\n\nDr. Weinberger
  earned a bachelor’s degree in 1998 at the University of Maryland\, Coll
 ege Park where he studied physics and biology. He then spent a year at the

 ey call Tor "the king of high-secure [sic] low-latency Internet anonymity"
  with "no contenders for the throne in waiting"\, and admit that even with
  their vast resources and massive data-centers\, even the NSA can only eff
 ectively attack a tiny fraction of Tor users at once. In this workshop\, T
 om Lowenthal --- formerly of the Tor Project -- will teach us how to use T
 or to browse the web safely. We'll learn a little about how Tor works\, an
 d what Tor can and can't protect against. Audience members are encouraged 
 to bring their laptops: this is a hands-on session. You should walk away w
 ith Tor installed\, and confident you can use it safely. This session is o
 pen to folks of all experience levels.\n\nBio:\nTom Lowenthal is a technol
 ogist and an activist who specializes in operational security and grassroo
 ts surveillance self-defense. A year ago\, his opinions on computer securi
 ty sounded over-the-top\, but now they barely seem adequate. He believes s
 trongly in individual privacy & personal freedom and tries to avoid making
  eye contact with security cameras.\, which doesn't work nearly as well as
  it sounds. Tom works to improve the state of usable liberations technolog
 ies and teach at-risk users about the steps they can take to be safe. He p
 reviously worked as a paranoia advocate at Mozilla\, and the Tor Project's

 re\nSpeaker: Hong-Yu (Henry) Chen\, Electrical Engineering\, Stanford Univ
 ersity\nAdvisor: Prof. H -S. Philip Wong\nDate: Wednesday\, April 9\, 2014

 um\n\nAbstract:\nAs NAND Flash faces challenges in continuing its rapid sc
 aling\, resistive switching random access memory (RRAM) has attracted sign
 ificant attention due to its strong potential as next generation memory de
 vices. A number of high-capacity RRAM chips have been demonstrated recentl
 y\, showing the potential use of RRAM for solid-state storage applications
 . Although RRAM has outperformed NAND Flash in many specs at the singe-dev
 ice level\, it is necessary to come up with a technology path towards 3D i
 ntegration for future mass storage.\n\nIn the first part of the presentati
 on\, a comprehensive investigation of a novel multi-layer stacked 3D verti
 cal RRAM array will be discussed\, including: (1) memory array architectur
 e without selection devices\; (2) device fabrication and characterization\
 ; (3) demonstration of array operation\; (4) study of vertical and horizon
 tal scaling limits\; (5) array write-operation robustness\; (6) 3D vertica
 l RRAM array analysis and optimization guidelines. Results obtained from b
 oth simulations and experiments illustrate the benefits and feasibility of
  a 3D multi-layer stacked vertical RRAM array.\n\nIn the second part of th
 e presentation\, I will present the exploration of future memory devices w
 ith the use of carbon-based nanomaterials in resistive switching memories.
  First\, I will introduce an electrode/oxide interface engineering techniq
 ue using single-layer Graphene (SLG)\, which can raise the low-resistance 
 state (LRS) by 100 times and offer an alternative method to study switchin
 g mechanisms in RRAM. Next\, laser scribing is an attractive graphene grow
 th and pattering technology because the process is low-cost\, time-efficie
 nt\, transfer-free and flexible. I will present the first demonstration of
  a resistive-switching memory component enabled by the laser scribing tech
 nology. Finally\, I will briefly discuss the use of carbon nanotubes (CNTs
 ) for emerging memory applications.\n\nBio:\nTBA\n\nLink: https://www.goog

 iversity\nDate: Wednesday\, April 9\, 2014\nTime: 3:00pm-4:00pm\nLocation:
  Gates 104\n\nAbstract:\nStatistical inference in high-dimensional probabi
 listic models (i.e.\, with many variables) is one of the central problems 
 of statistical machine learning and stochastic decision making. To date\, 
 only a handful of distinct methods have been developed\, most notably (MCM
 C) sampling\, decomposition\, and variational methods. In this talk\, I wi
 ll introduce a fundamentally new approach based on random projections and 
 combinatorial optimization. Our approach provides provable guarantees on a
 ccuracy\, and outperforms traditional methods in a range of domains\, in p
 articular those involving combinations of probabilistic and causal depende
 ncies (such as those coming from physical laws) among the variables. This 
 allows for a tighter integration between inductive and deductive reasoning
 \, and offers a range of new modeling opportunities. As an example\, I wil
 l discuss an application in the emerging field of Computational Sustainabi
 lity aimed at discovering new fuel-cell materials where we greatly improve
 d the quality of the results by incorporating prior background knowledge o
 f the physics of the system into the model.\n\nBio:\nStefano Ermon is curr
 ently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Cornell University\, where he
  started in the Fall of 2008. His research interests include combinatorial
  search\, probabilistic inference\, machine learning\, and optimization. H
 e works at the Intelligent Information Systems Institute (IISI) and at the
  Institute for Computational Sustainability (ICS) under the joint supervis
 ion of Carla Gomes and Bart Selman. Before coming to Cornell\, he graduate
 d summa cum laude with a BS and MS in Electrical Engineering from the Univ
 ersity of Padova. Stefano has (co-authored nearly 20 publications\, and ha
 s won several awards\, including two Best Student Paper Awards\, one Runne
 r-Up Prize\, and a McMullen Fellowship.\n\nLink: https://www.google.com/ca

  a significant development beyond prior systems because the video to be au
 gmented is all taken from a helicopter mounted camera which introduces sig
 nificant challenges.\n\nThe technology will be described that was develope
 d to track the America's Cup catamarans to within 2cm\, 5 times per second
 \, and superimpose graphics elements such as ahead-behind lines and laylin
 es on the live helicopter footage of the race. Previous America's Cup broa
 dcasts have only featured graphics visible in an animated view of the race
 . The LiveLine graphics package was designed to help viewers follow the in
 tense action of the AC72s as they flew around the race course on foils\, a
 ll in live action.\n\nIn addition to use for broadcast\, this tracking sys
 tem was used by the America's Cup Race Management team to revolutionize th
 e on the water management of the sport. With the ability to track the Amer
 ica's Cup catamarans within two-centimeters on the race course\, event org
 anizers quickly saw the opportunity to leverage the system for on-the-wate
 r management of the sport. Telemetering of the course allowed for rapid mo
 vement of marks and controlling course limits\, while use of real-time ove
 rlap and zone-entry determinations enabled umpires to make the most accura
 te umpiring decisions ever possible in sailing.\n\nThe technical and opera
 tional developments that lead to LiveLine graphics system and the related 
 race management and electronic umpiring systems will be described along wi
 th the problems and pitfalls.\n\nBio:\nBay Area resident Stan Honey (USA)\

 0\, 2014\nTime: 9:00am-10:00am (Refreshments served at 8:45am)\nLocation: 
 Packard 202\n\nAbstract:\nVery low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic waves a
 re generated by man-made transmitters\, lightning discharges and other nat
 ural phenomena. These signals can be used to study the earth's ionosphere\
 , magnetosphere and electrical environment. Due to the unique nature of th
 ese signals\, specialized VLF receiver hardware is required to receive the
 m.\n\nIn this talk we present the first single-chip broadband VLF magnetic
  field receiver. The receiver employs a low-noise amplifier and a continuo
 us-time delta-sigma modulator to achieve a sensitivity of under 1 fT/sqrt(
 Hz) and a spurious-free dynamic range of over 90 dB. This talk covers the 
 receiver architecture\, circuit implementation\, lab measurement results a
 nd field test results. The single-chip receiver is also compared with the 
 existing VLF receiver deployed by the Stanford VLF research group.\n\nBio:

  CS Theory Lunch\nTitle: TBA\nSpeaker: Prof. Don Knuth\, Art of Computer P
 rogramming\, Stanford University\nDate: Thursday\, April 10\, 2014\nTime: 
 12:15 pm - 1:00 pm\nLocation: Gates 463 A\n\nAbstract:\nTBA\n\nBio:\nDonal
 d Knuth's parents were Ervin Henry Knuth and Louise Marie Bohning. Donald'
 s father Ervin was a school teacher who taught in a Lutheran school. He pl
 ayed a very important role in determining Donald's interests\, and it was 
 through his father that that Donald gained his love for education\, music\
 , and mathematics. Ervin played the church organ at the Sunday church serv
 ices and Donald soon became a passionate lover of the organ.\n\nDonald att
 ended Lutheran schools and from the special emphasis that was placed on En
 glish grammar in these schools came Knuth's love of investigating sentence
  structure. His fascination with this in his first couple of years of seco
 ndary school would lead naturally towards writing computer code when he ev
 entually encountered computers\, but this did not happen until after his s
 chool education was complete. During these first years at secondary school
  there were other signs of where Knuth's interests would eventually lead. 
 One episode\, repeated in most biographies of Knuth but still worth repeat
 ing in this one\, concerns "Ziegler's Giant Bar."\n\nHe entered a competit
 ion set up by the confectionary manufacturer Ziegler. The aim was to see h
 ow many words could be made with the letters of "Ziegler's Giant Bar" and 
 for the schoolboy Knuth this was exactly the sort of challenge that he lov
 ed. He spent two weeks during which he pretended to be ill and\, using a d
 ictionary\, he came up with 4500 words. The judges for the competition had
  only found 2500 and Knuth was an easy winner. He commented afterwards tha
 t had he thought to use the apostrophe he could have found many more! His 
 school benefited by receiving a television set as a prize.\n\nAt high scho
 ol Knuth's interests were more directed towards music than they were to ma
 thematics. His musical interests involved both playing and composing music
  and he decided at that stage that he would study music after graduating f
 rom high school. Knuth played the saxophone\, and later the tuba\, in his 
 school band. Although he spent much time with his musical interests\, Knut
 h most certainly did not neglect his other school subjects. He graduated f
 rom High School in 1956 with the highest grade point average that anyone h
 ad ever achieved at his school.\n\nAt school he had begun to show an inter
 est in mathematics and he amused himself by trying to visualise surfaces i
 n several dimensions by plotting the graphs obtained by keeping all but on
 e of the variables fixed. This is an excellent way to understand mathemati
 cal functions and today with the aid of computers this\, and more sophisti
 cated techniques\, can quickly give students a deep understanding. However
  Knuth had to plot his graphs by doing hand calculations for every value w
 hich he plotted\, showing the same sort of dedication to putting hours of 
 work into problems that he had shown with the "Ziegler's Giant Bar" compet
 ition. One might have thought that his teachers would have believed that h
 e could succeed at college in almost any subject he chose given his outsta
 nding school performance\, but this was not really so. The problem was tha
 t Knuth did not believe in himself at this stage in his life and so his te
 achers doubted whether he had the personality\, in particular the confiden
 ce\, to succeed.\n\nIt shows how undecided Knuth was about the direction h
 is studies might take that when offered a scholarship to Case Institute of
  Technology in Cleveland\, Ohio\, to study physics he accepted despite his
  previous intentions to study music. He entered the physics course at the 
 Case Institute in September 1956. There were really two reasons why\, from
  his second year on\, Knuth started to move towards mathematics and away f
 rom physics. One day when Knuth was meant to be performing with the Colleg
 e band he missed the bus taking the band to the performance so\, finding h
 imself with free time\, he tried to solve a challenge problem that one of 
 his mathematics professors had set. Solving it earned Knuth an automatic "
 A" in that class and also the right sort of boost he needed to think that 
 perhaps mathematics rather than physics was for him. Secondly he found tha
 t physics practicals did not suit him\, so in the end the move towards mat
 hematics became a natural one to make.\n\nIn fact Knuth already had his fi
 rst encounter with computers in his first year at Case before he made the 
 move towards mathematics. He had to use the IBM 650 and consulted the manu
 al to find out how to write programs [1]:-\n\n    ... the manual we got fr
 om IBM would show examples of programs and I knew I could do ... better th
 an that. So I thought I might have some talent. \n\nKnuth used his growing
  expertise at writing computer programs to produce one in 1958 to analyse 
 the performance of the College basketball team. It led to some publicity a
 nd IBM used a photograph of Knuth in their advertising. One might have exp
 ected that events would begin to help him overcome his inferiority complex
  but he still felt that he was not up to standard. This had the effect of 
 making him put in large amounts of extra work at his academic studies. The
  result was that when he graduated with his B.S. in June 1960 he was award
 ed a distinction and\, in a quite unique move\, the College awarded him a 
 Master's Degree at the same time\, such was the brilliance of his performa
 nce. Knuth was awarded two Fellowships\, a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship and a
  National Foundation Fellowship in the year of his graduation.\n\nIt is a 
 real achievement to publish a mathematics paper while still a doctoral stu
 dent\, but Knuth managed to publish two papers in the year he completed hi
 s undergraduate degree. These were An imaginary number system and On metho
 ds of constructing sets of mutually orthogonal Latin squares using a compu
 ter I the latter paper being written jointly with R C Bose and I M Chakrav
 arti. In the first Knuth describes an imaginary number system using the im
 aginary number 2i as its base\, giving methods for the addition\, subtract
 ion and multiplication of the numbers. In the second paper Knuth and his c
 o-authors give two sets of five mutually orthogonal Latin squares of order
  12.\n\nIn the autumn of 1960 Knuth entered the California Institute of Te
 chnology and\, in June 1963\, he was awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics for hi
 s thesis Finite semifields and projective planes. In fact in addition to t
 he work for his doctorate in mathematics\, Knuth had from 1960 begun to pu
 t his very considerable computing expertise to uses other than writing pap
 ers becoming a software development consultant to the Burroughs Corporatio
 n in Pasadena\, California. Knowledge of his computing expertise was so we
 ll established by 1962 that\, although he was still a doctoral student at 
 the time\, Addison-Wesley approached him and asked him to write a text on 
 compilers. He began that project in the summer of 1962.\n\nHis publication
 s from this time show that he was applying computing to combinatorial math
 ematical problems which were not connected to the work he was undertaking 
 for his thesis. For example he computed Euler's constant to 1271 decimal p
 laces and published the result in 1962. In the same year he published work
  on the evaluation of polynomials by computer. Despite Knuth's remarkable 
 mathematical productivity he did find time for other things. During his ye
 ars as a graduate student Knuth married Nancy Jill Carter on 24 June 1961.
  Their two children John Martin Knuth and Jennifer Sierra Knuth were born 
 in 1965 and 1966 respectively.\n\nWe noted above that the title of Knuth's
  Ph.D. thesis was Finite semifields and projective planes. A semifield is 
 an algebraic structure satisfying all the usual axioms for a division ring
  except associativity of multiplication. The thesis contains a wealth of i
 nformation on finite semifields and their connections to certain types of 
 projective planes. After completion of his doctorate in 1963 Knuth became 
 an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the California Institute of Techn
 ology\, being promoted to Associate Professor i\n\nLink: https://www.googl

 \nTime: 2:30pm-3:30pm\nLocation: LK130 (Li Ka Shing Center)\n\nAbstract:\n
 Although all cells in our body contain the same genetic material\, they ca
 n perform vastly different functions by selectively expressing subsets of 
 their genes. Cell-type-specific gene regulation is achieved through intera
 ctions between regulatory proteins and epigenetic mechanisms\, which affec
 t the structural organization of the genome. Characterizing these interact
 ions is important for understanding the causes of genetic diseases and for
  identifying potential targets for intervention.\n\nThrough computational 
 analysis of changes in epigenetic state across genomic contexts and indivi
 duals\, we were able to demonstrate that the effects of epigenetic variati
 on on gene regulation are highly combinatorial. Motivated by these results
 \, we developed a machine learning framework for discovering cell-type-spe
 cific regulatory mechanisms. Our method integrates several data sources in
 cluding gene expression\, DNA sequence information\, cell-type-specific ep
 igenetic state\, and information regarding protein interactions. Using lar
 ge-scale datasets from the Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE Projects\, we re
 constructed the regulatory programs of a large number of human cell types.
  Our model achieves high predictive power and discovers novel cell-type-sp
 ecific regulatory features and context-specific interactions between them.

 eaker: Nir Eyal\, Author\, Consultant\, Advisor\nDate: Thursday\, April 10
 \, 2014\nTime: 5:00pm-6:30pm\nLocation: PARC (George E. Pake Auditorium)\,

 o-build-habit-forming-products-tickets-10978863075\n\nAbstract:\nIn an age
  of ever-increasing distractions\, quickly creating customer habits is an 
 important characteristic of successful products. How do companies create p
 roducts people use every day? What are the secrets of building services cu
 stomers love? How can designers create products compelling enough to "hook
 " users? \n\nNir Eyal\, the author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming P
 roducts\, has constructed a practical framework for designing better produ
 cts. The framework gives product managers\, designers\, and marketers a ne
 w way for thinking of the necessary components of changing user behavior. 
 Nir will share the tactics companies like Facebook\, Pinterest\, Instagram
 \, Whatsapp\, and Twitter use to drive engagement.\n\nHabit design is a su
 per power. If used for good\, habit design can enhance people’s lives wi
 th entertaining and even healthful routines. If used for evil\, habits can
  quickly turn into wasteful addictions.\n\nCompanies need to know how to h
 arness the power of hooks to improve peoples’ lives. At this PARC Forum\
 , attendees will learn:\n\n- The common design patterns of habit-forming p
 roducts.\n\n- The stages of habit formation and how to optimize for user r
 etention.\n\n- An in-depth look at the psychology behind what drives user 
 behavior and how to build products to cater to core human needs. \n\n- Pra
 ctical steps for leading a habit design process to ensure your product is 
 used regularly.\n\nBio:\nNir Eyal writes\, consults\, and teaches about th
 e intersection of psychology\, technology\, and business. He is the author
  of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products. Nir founded two tech comp
 anies since 2003 and has taught at the Stanford Graduate School of Busines
 s and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford.\n\nNir is also a
 n advisor to several Bay Area start-ups \, venture capitalists\, and incub
 ators. Nir’s last company received venture funding from Kleiner Perkins 
 Caufield & Byers and was acquired in 2011. In addition to blogging at NirA
 ndFar.com\, Nir is a contributing writer for Forbes\, TechCrunch\, and Psy
 chology Today. \n\nNir attended The Stanford Graduate School of Business a
 nd Emory University.\n****************************************************

 BA\n\nBio:\nBalasubramanian Narasimhan:\nI was born in India and studied m
 athematics at Loyola College in Madras\,  applied mathematics at P.S.G. Co
 llege of Technology in Coimbatore.  I obtained my doctorate in Statistics 
 in the Department of Statistics at Florida State University under George M
 arsaglia.  I taught at University of Minnesota\, Morris and Penn State Uni
 versity\, Erie\, before moving to Stanford University where I hold a joint
  appointment both in the Department of Statistics and Department of Health
  Research and Policy.\n\nI met my wife\, Kathryn\, as a graduate student a
 t Florida State. We have two daughters\, Jaya and Sashi.\n\nMy main hobbie
 s are music\, tennis\, and reading. I love classical music (both western a
 nd Indian) and I take piano lessons. I am very interested in Indian histor
 y and personalities in Indian history. (Oh! I get irrational when discussi
 ng Seminole football.)\n\nProf. Russ Altman: \nDr. Altman's primary intere
 sts are in the application of computing technologies to basic molecular bi
 ological problems\, now referred to as bioinformatics. He is particularly 
 interested in the analysis of protein and RNA structure and function\, bot
 h in an individual problem-centered manner and on a functional genomic sca
 le. He has an interest in applying systems biology concepts to pharmacolog
 y and personalized medicine. His core initial work was the development of 
 probabilistic algorithms for the determination of protein structure from s
 parse and uncertain experimental data. These algorithms have been shown to
  have some advantages over other methods of structure determination includ
 ing the ability to calculate not only a protein conformation\, but also an
  explicit estimate of the uncertainty in the position of each atom. His cu
 rrent efforts are in three areas. First\, he is interested in techniques f
 or representing biological knowledge (not just data) for automatic scienti
 fic computation. His group is working on representing the contents of the 
 scientific literature for pharmacogenomics (http://www.pharmgkb.org/) in o
 rder to support the task of building robust models of biological systems. 
 As part of this work\, the group is also interested in novel user interfac
 es to biological data\, and computational architectures for knowledge envi
 ronments. Second\, he is interested in the analysis of microenvironments w
 ithin macromolecules. In particular\, his group is developing methods for 
 statistically analyzing related structures to infer the key conserved feat
 ures that distinguish these structures from unrelated structures. This wor
 k has implications for the recognition of functional sites in proteins\, f
 or protein engineering\, and for drug design (http://feature.stanford.edu/
 ). Finally\, he is interested in physics-based simulation of biological st
 ructures\, particularly RNA and proteins. Within this broad area\, our foc
 us has been on creating coarse-grain representations of RNA\, and on combi
 ning machine learning and informatics methods with simulation to maximize 
 the performance of each (http://simbios.stanford.edu/).\n*****************

 \, Khosla Ventures \nDate: Monday\, April 14\, 2014\nTime: 12:15 pm - 1:05
  pm\nLocation: Li Ka Shing Center\, room 101\n\nAbstract:\nTBA\n\nBio:\nA 
 scientist and business professional\, Euan’s commitment to innovation ha
 s enabled him to play pioneering roles with a series of breakthrough techn
 ologies. Prior to joining Khosla Ventures\, Euan had more than 14 years of
  experience as a CEO\, managing both private and public companies.\n\nTrai
 ned as a physicist at the University of London\, Euan devoted more than fi
 fteen years to research\, teaching\, clinical practice\, and administratio
 n within the United Kingdom health care system. In parallel\, Euan formed 
 a successful consultancy practice\, providing advice for companies and hos
 pitals on scientific development\, product marketing\, and management. Ser
 ving premier clients such as Varian Medical Systems and Radionics\, Inc.\,
  he cultivated a specialty in development\, positioning\, regulatory appro
 vals\, pricing\, and reimbursement of U.S. products for international mark
 ets.\n\nIn 2002\, Euan joined Accuray Inc.\, then a small\, privately-held
  company. Directing the company’s evolution from its latent promise to a
  global company\, he applied his foundation of science and technological e
 xpertise to secure worldwide clinical acceptance for CyberKnife® Radiosur
 gery through the creation of protocols and studies for treatment of tumors
  in the brain\, spine\, lung\, liver\, pancreas\, prostate and breast\; an
 d improved Accuray’s intellectual property portfolio from five issued U.
 S. patents in FY 2001 to 290 issued U.S. and Foreign patents by the end of
  2012. Expanding both the reach and scope of the organization\, Euan built
  distribution channels in more than 80 countries\; he executed a strategic
  sales alliance with Siemens Healthcare and consummated the successful acq
 uisition of TomoTherapy®\, Inc. in 2011. Both at Accuray and his prior co
 mpany\, Photoelectron Inc\, Euan initiated and directed a host of sophisti
 cated financial transactions including private and public investments and 
 Initial Public Offerings. The successful 2007 Accuray IPO was priced above
  range\, and approximately 10x oversubscribed. Applying considerable busin
 ess acumen to his role at Accuray\, he has oversaw exponential revenue gro
 wth from $10 million in 2002 to more than $400 million in fiscal year 2012
 .\n\nEuan is a member of the Board of Directors of the Hospice of the Vall
 ey\, a hospice facility serving individuals with life-limiting illnesses. 
 Euan has served as Chair of the California Division of the American Cancer
  Society’s CEO’s Against Cancer. He is the recipient of an Ernst and Y
 oung Entrepreneur of the Year award (N. California\, Health & Life Science
 s)\, and an ABBY Award from the Adaptive Business Leaders Organization for
  his innovation in biotechnology. Having earned a B.S. in Physics\, an M.S
 . in Radiation Physics\, and a Ph.D. in Physics\, Euan is the author of nu
 merous scientific papers and personally holds six U.S. patents.\n*********

 on Microscopy\nSpeaker: Prof. Bo Huang\, Pharmaceutical Chemistry\, UCSF\n
 Organizer: Prof. Ron Dror\, Computer Science\, Stanford University\nDate: 
 Monday\, April 14\, 2014\nTime: 4:15pm-5:15pm\nLocation: Y2E2-111\n\nIn sp
 ring quarter the ICME Colloquium and LA/Opt seminars will be combined and 
 will be on Mondays at 4:15pm in Stanford's Math Corner.\n \nRon Dror is or
 ganizing seminars around a computational biology theme.\n\nAbstract:\nIn s
 uper-resolution microscopy methods based on single-molecule switching (STO
 RM/PALM)\, each camera frame samples a random\, sparse subset of probe mol
 ecules in the samples. The final super-resolution image is assembled with 
 the molecule coordinates extracted from thousands of frames. We have devel
 oped a sparse-signal recovery technique using compressed sensing to analyz
 e camera images with highly overlapping fluorescent spots. This method all
 ows one camera image to sample an order of magnitude more fluorophores\, t
 hus improving the temporal resolution of live imaging. In order to increas
 e the total duration of observation limited by fluorophore photobleaching\
 , we utilized the redundant information from adjacent snapshots in a time 
 sequence. With a deformable registration algorithm\, we have effectively r
 educed the number of camera frames required for super-resolution image rec
 onstruction. Finally\, we developed a framework for correlation analysis o
 f coordinate-based super-resolution images. We have shown a variety of app
 lications of this framework\, including image alignment\, single-molecule 
 tracking and the quantification of colocalization.\n\nBio:\nTBA\n*********

  To Do About It\nSpeaker: Bruce Schneier\, Fellow\, Berkman Center for Int
 ernet and Society\, Harvard Law School\nDate: Tuesday\, April 15\, 2014\nT
 ime: 5:00pm-7:00pm\nLocation: Stanford Law School - Room 280B\, 559 Nathan
  Abbott Way\, Stanford\, CA \n\nRSVP is required for this free event. http

 iewform\n\n5:00pm Reception - Manning Faculty Lounge\n6:00pm Talk Begins -
  Room 290\n\nAbstract:\nEdward Snowden has given us an unprecedented windo
 w into the NSA's surveillance activities. Drawing from both the Snowden do
 cuments and revelations from previous whistleblowers\, this talk describes
  the sorts of surveillance the NSA conducts and how it conducts it. The em
 phasis will be on the technical capabilities of the NSA\, and not the poli
 tics or legality of their actions. I will then discuss what sorts of count
 ermeasures are likely to frustrate any nation-state adversary with these s
 orts of capabilities. These will be techniques to raise the cost of wholes
 ale surveillance in favor of targeted surveillance: ubiquitous encryption\
 , target dispersal\, anonymity tools\, and so on.\n\nBio:\nBruce Schneier 
 is an internationally renowned security technologist\, called a "security 
 guru" by The Economist. He is the author of 12 books -- including Liars an
 d Outliers: Enabling the Trust Society Needs to Thrive -- as well as hundr
 eds of articles\, essays\, and academic papers. His influential newsletter
  "Crypto-Gram" and his blog "Schneier on Security" are read by over 250\,0
 00 people. He has testified before Congress\, is a frequent guest on telev
 ision and radio\, has served on several government committees\, and is reg
 ularly quoted in the press. Schneier is a fellow at the Berkman Center for
  Internet and Society at Harvard Law School\, a program fellow at the New 
 America Foundation's Open Technology Institute\, a board member of the Ele
 ctronic Frontier Foundation\, an Advisory Board Member of the Electronic P
 rivacy Information Center\, and the Chief Technology Officer at Co3 System

 mputer Systems Colloquium\nTitle: Insights into The Nature of Time in Phys
 ics\, and Implications for Computer Science\nSpeaker: Paul Borrill\, Found
 er and CEO\, EARTH Computing\, Inc.\nDate: Wednesday\, April 16\, 2014\nTi
 me: 4:15 pm - 5:30 pm\nLocation: Gates B03\n\nAbstract:\nThe concept of ti
 me is a well recognized enigma in physics. According to the great physicis
 t John Archibald Wheeler: Beyond all day-to-day problems in physics\, in t
 he profound issues of principle that confront us today\, no difficulties a
 re more central than those associated with the concept of time. In compute
 r science\, we tend to sweep these issues under the rug\, and rely on an o
 verly-simplistic concept of linear time that implicitly includes notions s
 uch as simultaneity and irreversibility\, which are known to be incorrect 
 in our two most successful physical theories: Relativity and Quantum Mecha
 nics. Part One of this lecture reviews the current state of our understand
 ing of time from physics. Part Two highlights the implicit assumptions we 
 so often use in computer science\, and their possible implications on the 
 correctness\, reliability and performance of our systems. Part Three intro
 duces a recently published conjecture on the relationship between informat
 ion\, entanglement and time\, as a vehicle to both challenge the way we th
 ink about time when we design our algorithms and develop our models of com
 putations. We hope to stimulate new ways of thinking that advance computer
  science down richer and perhaps more innovative paths.\n\nBio:\nPaul Borr
 ill is founder and CEO of EARTH Computing\, inc.\, and is a leading indust
 ry expert on the foundations of IT Infrastructures. He served as VP/CTO fo
 r VERITAS Software\; VP/Chief Architect for Storage Systems at Quantum\; D
 istinguished Engineer\, Director of Architecture & Performance and Chief S
 cientist of Information Resources at Sun Microsystems. He founded the Stor
 age Networking Industry Association (SNIA)\, serving as its Chairman\, and
  served several terms as Vice President and member of the Governing Board 
 of the IEEE Computer Society. His lifelong interest in dependable computin
 g came from working with NASA\, designing computer systems & software for 
 an experiment which performed extraordinarily well on flight 51c of the Sp
 ace Shuttle. Paul earned his Ph.D in physics from University College Londo
 n and is a graduate of the Stanford Executive Program. \n*****************

 Statisticians\, and Computer Scientists to create the analytical approache
 s behind the AncestryDNA direct-to-consumer genotyping services. Cathy is 
 a genomic scientist who has annotated and mined the genomes of various org
 anisms and created resources to help other scientists exploit and explore 
 genome data. She has collaborated on the annotation of the first eukaryoti
 c genome (brewer's yeast) and has collaboratively built databases to explo
 re the genomes of yeast\, E. coli and the bacterium that causes tuberculos
 is. As a pioneer in data analysis resources for high-throughput biomedical
  technologies\, she led the Stanford Microarray Database\, the largest aca
 demic database of its kind. Cathy has used high-throughput biomedical data
  to shed light on diverse research topics\, from the biology of infectious
  organisms to the mechanisms involved in cell division and cancer. She rec
 eived a B.S. in Biology and a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the Universi

 nLocation: Stanford Law School - Room 280B\, 559 Nathan Abbott Way\, Stanf
 ord\, CA \n\nRSVP is required for this free event. https://docs.google.com

 n - 5:30pm\nWorkshop - 6:00pm\n\nAbstract:\nPretty-good-privacy or PGP is 
 the world's most widely-used email encryption system\, capable of protecti
 ng the contents of messages from interception by anyone from an ISP to the
  NSA. In this workshop Tom Lowenthal will introduce us to PGP\, explain ho
 w to use it and teach us some of its foibles. Audience members are encoura
 ged to bring their laptops: the session will be hands on\, and you should 
 walk away with the software installed and configured. Folks of any technic
 al experience level are welcome at this session. There's plenty to cover\,
  and the material will be tailored to the level of the room.\n\nBio:\nTom 
 Lowenthal is a technologist and an activist who specializes in operational
  security and grassroots surveillance self-defense. A year ago\, his opini
 ons on computer security sounded over-the-top\, but now they barely seem a
 dequate. He believes strongly in individual privacy & personal freedom and
  tries to avoid making eye contact with security cameras.\, which doesn't 
 work nearly as well as it sounds. Tom works to improve the state of usable
  liberations technologies and teach at-risk users about the steps they can
  take to be safe. He previously worked as a paranoia advocate at Mozilla\,
  and the Tor Project's coordinator. He holds a B.A. in Political Theory wi
 th Computer Science and Technology Policy from Princeton University. You c

 owenthal.com.\n***********************************************************

 ics and Philosophy in Tübingen and Göttingen and did a PhD on Quantum Ph
 ase Transitions before he switched to model Real Life. He worked with Gün
 ter Wagner at Yale and started his own group in Munich in 2002 with the he
 lp of an Emmy Noether research grant by the German Research Foundation (DF
 G). In October 2007\, he started his position as a Professor of Mathematic
 s and Biosciences at the University of Vienna.\n\nJoachim's work is on the
 oretical population genetics where he combines molecular and phenotypic ap
 proaches. He is particularly interested in the evolutionary conditions for
  adaptation and speciation. Recent projects range from the evolution of as
 sortative mating under frequency-dependent disruptive selection to the stu
 dy of selective sweeps and the footprint of selection in molecular adaptat
 ion. A special research focus is on the effects of gene-gene and gene-envi
 ronment interactions on genetic variation and the adaptive process (epista
 tis and evolvability) and on the evolution of the genotype-phenotype map (
 robustness\, canalization\, and modularity). \n***************************

 ay\, April 28\, 2014\nTime: 4:15pm-5:15pm\nLocation: Y2E2-111\n\nIn spring
  quarter the ICME Colloquium and LA/Opt seminars will be combined and will
  be on Mondays at 4:15pm in Stanford's Math Corner.\n \nRon Dror is organi
 zing seminars around a computational biology theme.\n\nAbstract:\nElectros
 tatic forces and the electrostatic properties of molecules in solution are
  among the most important issues in understanding the structure and functi
 on of large biomolecules. The use of implicit-solvent models\, such as the
  Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE)\, have been used with great success as a
  way of computationally deriving electrostatics properties such molecules.
  We discuss how to solve an elliptic system of partial differential equati
 ons (PDEs) involving the Poisson and the PBEs using path-integral based pr
 obabilistic\, Feynman-Kac\, representations. This leads to a Monte Carlo m
 ethod for the solution of this system which is specified with a stochastic
  process\, and a score function. We use several techniques to simplify the
  Monte Carlo method and the stochastic process used in the simulation\, su
 ch as the walk-on-spheres (WOS) algorithm\, and an auxiliary sphere techni
 que to handle internal boundary conditions. We then specify some optimizat
 ions using the error (bias) and variance to balance the CPU time. We show 
 that our approach is as accurate as widely used deterministic codes\, but 
 has many desirable properties that these methods do not. In addition\, the
  currently optimized codes consume comparable CPU times to the widely used
  deterministic codes. Thus\, we have an very clear example where a Monte C
 arlo calculation of a low-dimensional PDE is as fast or faster than determ
 inistic techniques at similar accuracy levels.\n\nBio:\nMichael Mascagni w
 as born in Bologna\, Italy of one American and one Italian parent.  Howeve
 r\, by the age of four he was in the US confusing his Lake Forest\, Illino
 is kindergarten teacher (and American grandmother) by correctly answering 
 her Italian.  This confusion continued though High School in Clinton\, Iow
 a and College at the University of Iowa.  At Iowa\, he obtained a B.S.E. i
 n Biomedical Engineering\, and a B.S. in Mathematics and was a member of P
 hi Beta Kappa and Tau Beta Pi\, the top liberal arts and engineering acade
 mic honor societies.\n\nAfter graduation\, he seriously considered going t
 o Medical School\, and declined two such offers to instead study Neurobiol
 ogy at the Rockefeller University\, which is located on the East River the
  middle of Manhattan.  Since "the Rock" is such a small and specialized Un
 iversity\, he also took graduate classes uptown\, at Columbia University\,
  and downtown\, at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New Y
 ork University.  Eventually\, downtown trumped midtown and uptown\, and Ma
 thematics trumped Neurobiology\, and he obtained his M.S. and Ph.D. in Mat
 hematics from Courant.  Perhaps more importantly\, his social contacts at 
 "the Rock" introduced him to his future wife\, Becky Fandrei\, at a party 
 during an historic snow storm in New York.  They were married between the 
 Masters and Doctoral degrees.\n\nUpon graduation\, he obtained a post-doct
 oral research position in the Mathematical Research Branch of an institute
  of the National Institutes of Health\, in Bethesda\, MD and they moved to
  Washington\, DC.  It was during this period his research moved away from 
 modeling the nervous system to studying the high-performance computing imp
 lications of the algorithms he developed and used.  He was one of the firs
 t to use random number-based algorithms on the massively parallel Connecti
 on Machine at the Naval Research Lab in DC.  In fact\, after two years at 
 NIH he moved to the Institute for Defense Analyses' Supercomputing Researc
 h Center in Bowie\, MD.  This organization works for the National Security
  Agency\, and it was here that his interests in parallel computing\, rando
 m number generation\, number theory\, and discrete mathematics were nurtur
 ed.  During his time at SRC his oldest sons Alexander and Marcus were born
 \, and are now both Eagle Scouts.\n\nAfter many happy years at SRC\, he de
 cided to rejoin academia\, and went to the University of Southern Mississi
 ppi to run the Graduate Program in Scientific Computing.  After a few year
 s there\, a desire to join a Computer Science department arose\, and he mo
 ved to Florida State University as an Associate Professor of Computer Scie
 nce\, he has since been promoted to Full Professor.  While at FSU his youn
 gest son\, Evan\, was born.  At FSU he also has appointments as Professor 
 of Mathematics\, Professor of Scientific Computing\, and a faculty member 
 of the Graduate Program in Molecular Biophysics.\n\nDr. Mascagni is on the
  editorial board of three journals in his field\, and is a member of the A
 CM (Association of Computing Machinery)\, SIAM (Society of Applied Mathema
 tics)\, the Swiss Speedup Society and IMACS (International Association of 
 Mathematics and Computers in Simulation).  He is also an ACM Distinguished
  Scientist and a member of the Board of Directors of IMACS.  He has approx
 imately 130 refereed technical papers that have appeared in a wide variety
  of publications in areas including Applied Mathematics\, Computer Science
 \, Simulation Science\, Monte Carlo Methods\, Computational Science\, High
 -Performance Computing\, Scientific Computing\, Computational Physics\, an
 d Computational Neuroscience.  He has been a visiting professor at the Uni
 versity of Padova in Italy\, the University of Salzburg in Austria\, the U
 niversity of the South-Toulon and Var in France\, and the Swiss Federal Te
 chnical Institute-Zürich in Switzerland\, and is a consultant to industri
 es and governments across the globe.  He has made technical presentations 
 in 25 countries and in most of the 50 U.S. states.  Most recently he has b
 een made a Faculty Appointee at the National Institute of Standards and Te
 chnology in Maryland.\n\nThe areas of research that Dr. Mascagni's researc
 h team work on are parallel and distributed computing\, Grid computing\, C
 loud computing\, random number generation\, Monte Carlo methods\, computat
 ional number theory and discrete algorithms\, and applications to material
 s science\, biochemistry\, electrostatics\, and finance.\n\nHis hobbies in
 clude swimming and biking\, which arise from his misspent youth at NYU whe
 re he commuted by bicycle and swam each day\, and playing the violin.  In 
 fact\, he has been the concertmaster of the Big Bend Community Orchestra i
 n Tallahassee and on its Board of Directors\, and even its President and h
 e has played with several orchestras in places like Washington\, DC\, Salz
 burg\, Austria and Zürich\, Switzerland. He is now also the President of 
 The Artist Series\, which presents professional chamber music concerts to 
 appreciative audiences in the Florida Big Bend\, and is first violin in Be
 ethoven's Revenge\, a string quartet.  He has also been an active adult le
 ader in Troop 118 in Tallahassee\, and Troop 684 in Zürich\, Switzerland\
 , and has been to the International Scout Centre in Kandersteg\, Switzerla
 nd\, and all of the North American BSA High Adventure Bases on challenging
  treks involving backpacking\, canoeing\, sailing\, and snorkeling.\n*****

  - 6:00pm\n\nAbstract:\nIn this talk\, EFF's Technology Projects Director 
 Peter Eckersley will survey they state of Internet security and surveillan
 ce in the wake of Edward Snowden's revelations. It is unlikely that we can
  protect most Internet users against sophisticated\, targeted attacks by t
 heir own and other governments\, but there is more reason to be optimistic
  that we might shield the bulk of users' data against the type of dragnet 
 surveillance that the US and other governments are conducting.\n\nPeter wi
 ll discuss the things that individual users can currently do to achieve st
 ronger communications security\; the (often very subtle) technical aspects
  to deploying HTTPS/TLS/SSL securely on the server side\; some of the impo
 rtant places where our existing protocols are letting us down from a secur
 ity and privacy perspective\; the terrible dynamics of cross border-survei
 llance\; and what we could do to change all of this.\n\nBio:\nPeter Eckers
 ley is Technology Projects Director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation
 . He keeps his eyes peeled for technologies that\, by accident or design\,
  pose a risk to computer users' freedoms—and then looks for ways to fix 
 them. He explains gadgets to lawyers\, and lawyers to gadgets. Peter's wor
 k at EFF has included privacy and security projects such as Panopticlick\,
  HTTPS Everywhere\, SSDI\, and the SSL Observatory\; helping to launch a m
 ovement for open wireless networks\; fighting to keep modern computing pla
 tforms open\; and running the first controlled tests to confirm that Comca
 st was using forged reset packets to interfere with P2P protocols.\n\nPete
 r holds a PhD in computer science and law from the University of Melbourne
 \; his research focused on the practicality and desirability of using alte
 rnative compensation systems to legalize P2P file sharing and similar dist
 ribution tools while still paying authors and artists for their work. He i
 s an affiliate of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at
  Stanford University.\n***************************************************

 ize over various time-scales. He is also interested in how complex adaptiv
 e landscapes contribute to the evolutionary trajectories we see in adaptat
 ion. Ben uses a combination of theoretical approaches with experimental ev
 olution and genomic inference to test theoretical predictions. \n*********

 ne Glasgow serves as vice president\, global product management for eBay M
 arketplaces\, and brings more than 15 years of experience leading product 
 design and development\, innovation in search technology\, and management 
 to the world’s largest online marketplace. In his role\, Dane focuses on
  delivering a compelling shopping experience globally for both buyers and 
 sellers – from eBay’s homepage and search experience\, to tailored ver
 ticals in the Fashion and Electronics categories\, to an end-to-end sellin
 g experience. Working closely with eBay’s North American and European bu
 siness teams\, Dane and his worldwide team of product managers\, designers
 \, and data managers aim to surface the best deals\, drive increased busin
 ess conversion and grow customer satisfaction across more than 94 million 
 active users and $62 billion in gross merchandize volume globally (2010). 
 In December 2010\, Dane helped lead eBay’s acquisition of Milo\, a local
  shopping engine\, and now manages the integration of Milo’s local comme
 rce solution into the eBay customer experience.\n\nDane previously served 
 as eBay’s vice president of engineering\, where his team brought an incr
 eased level of structure and depth to the eBay Global Product Catalog\, an
  ever-growing master resource of structured data to categorize and manage 
 eBay’s vast selection of inventory.\n\nDane joined eBay in December of 2
 008 through the acquisition of Positronic\, a company he co-founded in Sea
 ttle. Positronic developed a sophisticated machine learning and natural la
 nguage processing platform in the finance sector. As Positronic’s chief 
 technology officer\, Dane set the software vision – driving the architec
 ture and roadmap to achieve positive results. Positronic’s technology an
 d team were integrated into eBay following the acquisition.\n\nBefore co-f
 ounding Positronic\, Dane was the director of program management at Micros
 oft for the Live Search product\, leading a talented team of program manag
 ers who were responsible for delivering fast\, relevant Search to customer
 s throughout the world. In coordination with the development and test orga
 nizations\, the team created the Web Search experience for Microsoft throu
 gh MSN.com\, Microsoft.com\, and Live.com\, including offerings for search
 ing Web pages\, Images\, News\, Products\, Videos\, and Blogs. All of thes
 e integrated experiences were geared toward helping hundreds of millions o
 f customers in nearly 50 different markets worldwide quickly find the info
 rmation that was most important to them.\n\nPrior to working on Live Searc
 h\, Dane served as the general manager for the Windows Live Portal & Clien
 t team. The group developed software ranging from the Live.com portal\, wh
 ich placed users at the center of their information experience\, to the MS
 N Search Toolbar\, which offered significant browsing and search enhanceme
 nts for Internet Explorer. In this role\, Dane delivered near-instant sear
 ch results for files and email on users' PCs through Windows Desktop Searc
 h. Dane also drove the acquisitions of Lookout Software\, a provider of fa
 st email searching for Microsoft Outlook\, and Onfolio\, a company deliver
 ing tools for browser-based research and information management. The team 
 went on to ship Windows Live Writer\, a desktop blog publishing applicatio
 n.\n\nPreviously\, he helped launch MS Ideas\, an internal site dedicated 
 to helping employees post\, discuss\, and collaborate on new product ideas
  and technologies. Dane also served as Group Manager of MSN Calendar - whi
 ch provided calendaring\, task management\, and notifications in numerous 
 languages through MSN Hotmail.\n\nDane joined Microsoft in April 1999 thro
 ugh the acquisition of Jump.com\, a company he helped create in Ithaca\, N
 .Y. Jump provided the first completely connected\, Internet-based email\, 
 calendar and tasks service. Dane served as president of Jump\, overseeing 
 product design\, technology partnerships\, and operations. Prior to Jump\,
  Dane served as vice president\, Ithaca Division of Meetinghouse Technolog
 ies\, a multimedia development company delivering consumer\, corporate\, a
 nd government software and services.\n\nDane attended Cornell University\,
  where he studied computer science\, business\, and fine arts. Outside of 
 the office\, he enjoys photography\, computer graphics\, amateur high alti
 tude ballooning/rocketry\, robotics\, helping educational and scientific-b
 ased charities\, and driving fast cars. Dane serves on the board of truste
 es for the SETI Institute\, a non-profit scientific organization whose mis
 sion is to explore\, understand and explain the origin\, nature\, and prev
 alence of life in the universe. \n****************************************

 \, Palo Alto Foundation Medical Group\nDate: Monday\, May 12\, 2014\nTime:
  12:15 pm - 1:05 pm\nLocation: Li Ka Shing Center\, room 101\n\nAbstract:\
 nTBA\n\nBio:\nAt PAMF\, Dr. Chan is the interface between patients\, provi
 ders\, and technology\, leveraging health IT to empower patients and the c
 are team to become better partners in health\, and ultimately transform th
 e way healthcare is delivered. He leads a clinical informatics team that f
 ocuses on the optimization of use of electronic health records (EHR) and p
 ersonal health records (EHR) for patient care delivery and clinical operat
 ions. Currently\, nearly 75% of adult PAMF patients and 50% of family care
 givers use My Health Online\, both via the web and on mobile devices to vi
 ew their health information\, schedule appointments\, and communicate with
  their doctors and other members of the care team.\n\nAs Medical Director 
 of the David Druker Center for Health Systems Innovation\, he works with a
 n interdisciplinary team of physicians\, nurses\, pharmacists\, nutritioni
 sts\, ethnographers and software engineers to innovate and cultivate new m
 odels of health care delivery. The Druker Center is engaged in two excitin
 g initiatives - EMPOWER-H (Engaging and Motivating Patients Online With En
 hanced Resources-for Hypertension)\, a new care delivery model designed to
  enhance the care of patients with hypertension\, including mobile applica
 tions to monitor blood pressure control and linkAgesTM\, a functional\, co
 ordinated and scalable ecosystem to promote Successful Aging for our senio
 rs and the communities they live in.\n\nPreviously\, Dr. Chan served as Co
 -Chair of California Health and Human Services Agency's Patient Engagement
  Work Group\, identifying innovative approaches to engaging and empowering
  patients and their families through the use of technology that harnesses 
 the HIE infrastructure\, and recommend how to incorporate these approaches
  into the State's HIE services. He was also Co-Chair of the Certification 
 Commission for Health Information Technology (CCHIT) Personal Health Recor
 ds Work Group\, which developed criteria for personal health record softwa
 re certification.\n\nDr. Chan earned a bachelor's degree with honors in Bi
 ological Sciences from Stanford University and a medical degree from the U
 niversity of California\, San Diego School of Medicine. He completed his r
 esidency and year as chief resident in family medicine at the San Jose Med
 ical Center Family Practice Residency\, affiliated with Stanford Universit
 y of School of Medicine. Albert concurrently completed a post-doctoral fel
 lowship in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University School of Medicin
 e and Family Medicine Research at the University of California\, San Franc
 isco School of Medicine\, studying the effects of point of care decision s
 upport in the management of hypertension. During fellowship\, Dr. Chan als
 o assisted with the launch of PAMFOnline\, one of the earliest PHRs in the
  United States.\n\nDr. Chan received the "Future Leader" Health Care Hero 
 Award from the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal in May 2012.\n****

 y\nDate: Wednesday\, May 14\, 2014\nTime: 12:00-1:00pm\nLocation: Y2E2 101
 \n\nLunch is provided.\n\nAbstract:\nConsumer auctions were very popular i
 n the early days of internet commerce\, but today online sellers mostly us
 e posted prices. Compositional shifts in the items being sold and the sell
 ers offering these items cannot account for this evolution. Instead\, the 
 returns to sellers using auctions have diminished. We consider two hypothe
 ses: a shift in buyer preferences away from auctions\, and an increase in 
 competition or search efficiency that favors favors posted prices. We use 
 a model and data from eBay to tease these apart\, finding that the former 
 is more important\, especially for more idiosyncratic products. We also di
 scuss why auctions and posted prices can coexist in online markets.\n\nBio
 : \nJonathan Levin is Professor of Economics at Stanford University. His r
 esearch interests include industrial organization and microeconomic theory

 enetics for graduate school. He recently completed his DPhil at Oxford und
 er the supervision of Cecilia Lindgren and Gil McVean\, and has since star
 ted a postdoctoral appointment in David Reich's lab at Harvard. Mathieson'
 s research focuses on developing population genetic based methods for infe
 rence which can be efficiently applied to large genomic datasets. In parti
 cular\, he develops methods to investigate population structure and histor
 y\, both as interesting quantities in themselves\, and as confounding fact
 ors in other analyses such as genome-wide association studies. Much of his
  research has been concerned with rare variants which\, now accessible thr
 ough sequence data\, can be highly informative about ancestry and relatedn
 ess. Mathieson intends to continue developing these methods and is particu
 larly excited about using them to investigate data from ancient DNA in ord
 er to develop a more nuanced picture of recent human history and evolution

 :\nSafa Motesharrei is a Research Assistant at SESYNC and a PhD candidate 
 in Applied Mathematics/Public Policy at the University of Maryland (UMD)\,
  College Park. He has Bachelor degrees in Electrical Engineering and Physi
 cs\, and Master degrees in Physics and Mathematics from UMD. The focus of 
 his work is on integration of the Human System and Population into the Ear
 th System Models. He works with a cross-disciplinary team of renowned scie
 ntists including Eugenia Kalnay (Atmospheric Science)\, James Yorke (Mathe
 matics)\, Matthias Ruth (Public Policy)\, Victor Yakovenko (Econophysics)\
 , Klaus Hubacek (Geography)\, Ning Zeng (Meteorology)\, and Fernando Miral
 les-Wilhelm (Hydrology).\n\nTogether with Jorge Rivas (Institute of Global
  Environment and Society) and Prof. Kalnay\, Safa has developed a minimal 
 dynamical model of Human and Nature\, HANDY\, which is the first model tha
 t shows not only Ecological Strain\, but also Economic Stratification can 
 lead to a societal collapse. Safa plays a leading role in the development 
 of the five-sector Human-Earth System model\, which includes Population\, 
 Climate\, Water\, Agriculture\, and Energy. This project has received supp
 ort from NASA.\n\nSafa’s studies were supported by doctoral fellowships 
 from the School of Public Policy and the Department of Mathematics at UMD.
  In summer 2013\, he was named the first recipient of the Lev Gandin Fello
 wship\, awarded by Dr. Genia Brin.\n**************************************

 ssional societies.  He was the recipient of the Outstanding Power Engineer
 ing Educator Award (1994)\, the Third Millenium Medal (2000) and the Herma
 n Halperin Electric Transmission & Distribution Award (2006)\, from the IE
 EE.  He has been recognized as a distinguished alumnus of the Indian Insti
 tute of Technology\, Kharagpur (2005) and the College of Engineering at Io
 wa State University (1993).\n\nAt Washington State University\, Dr. Bose h
 olds the endowed Distinguished Professorship in Power Engineering\, and is
  the Site Director of the NSF sponsored Power System Engineering Research 
 Center. From 1998 to 2005 he served as the Dean of the College of Engineer
 ing and Architecture which has about 150 faculty\, 75 staff members\, and 
 2500 students over four campuses. During that period\, the college doubled
  its annual research expenditures and donations while the state and tuitio
 n budgets decreased. From 1993 to 1998\, he was the Director of the School
  of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science which is the largest unit 
 in the college.\n\nBefore joining WSU\, Dr. Bose was on the faculty of Ari
 zona State University\, where he directed the Electric Power Research Labo
 ratory\, a cooperative research program (supported by the local power indu
 stry) that he helped establish in 1982. In addition\, his own research gro
 up became internationally known for applying computation technology to the
  control and analysis of large power grids. In 1988-89\, he was on leave f
 rom the university to manage the Program on Engineering Systems (Power) at
  the National Science Foundation.\n\nBefore ASU\, Dr. Bose worked for Cont
 rol Data Corporation in their Energy Management Systems Division (now Siem
 ens Energy Management & Information Systems).  He administered a research 
 group of over a dozen professionals and played a crucial role in the techn
 ical leadership of the division ($50 million yearly revenue)\, which becam
 e the leading vendor of power system control centers during this time.  Ma
 jor breakthroughs in power system control technology under his leadership 
 are industrial practice today.  He has continued to be a technical leader 
 in this industry and is a prominent consultant.\n\nHe has served on severa
 l editorial boards of IEEE publications and the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia o
 f Science & Technology.  He has also served\, some as chair\, on several i
 nternational technical committees and conference organizations.  He was ap
 pointed by the governor to the board of directors of the Washington Techno
 logy Center (served as Vice-Chair for three years)\, and by the US Secreta
 ry of Energy on the committee to study the 1999 and 2003 power blackouts. 
  He has consulted for many electric power companies and related government
  agencies throughout the world.\n*****************************************

 es for PayPal\, where I joined in April\, 2012.\nThousands of PayPalians a
 nd many systems benefit from the information that flows through our platfo
 rm today. We strive to add many new\, cutting edge capabilities to our pla
 tform. Hyper growth\, or even slow steady growth over time\, present chall
 enges with scaling and sustaining the technology stacks. In most successfu
 l enterprises\, yesterday’s technology stacks drive today’s businesses
 . They often do not meet stakeholder’s expectations and limiting further
  growth. Therefore\, the need for building a new and futuristic technology
  stack is prevalent but the challenge is building such system while suppor
 ting/delivering on the current commitments. This not only requires paralle
 l development (leapfrogging the current system in capabilities) but also r
 equires smart migration of the business to the new stacks. Hence\, I look 
 to empower our technologists to make the best choices in technology\, arch
 itecture\, and organization for building the new stacks.\n\nPrior to PayPa
 l\, I served as the CTO of Shopping.com\, where I oversaw all technology p
 latforms\, including research\, architecture\, engineering and operations.
  I joined Shopping.com in 2008\, and came from Yahoo where I served as Vic
 e President of Engineering\, Ad Systems. I was responsible for the archite
 cture\, development\, QA and operations of Yahoo's Graphical Ad Systems. P
 rior to Yahoo\, I was the VP of Engineering at Selectica\, where I directe
 d Applications and Operations. Before joining Selectica in 2000\, I held a
  variety of engineering and management positions with Menlo Park\, CA-base
 d Informix Software\, Inc.\, including director of Web Technology and Seni
 or Manager of Research and Development.\n\nI hold B.Sc. in Mathematics\, P
 ost B.Sc. in Computer Science and Master of Computer Applications. I am al
 so listed as an inventor on several patent applications for Yahoo Corporat
 ion related to online advertising and mobile monetization. \n*************

 Ensembles of solutions to partial differential equations underly mathemati
 cal theories of turbulence and phase transitions. However\, our understand
 ing of such ensembles for even well-understood PDE is quite modest. For ex
 ample\, there is no satisfactory theory of a soliton gas for NLS or KdV de
 spite a detailed understanding of these PDE that ranges from the classical
  (explicit N-solitons) to the modern (optimal well-posedness theorems). Pe
 rhaps the simplest nonlinear PDE are scalar conservation laws. I will pres
 ent a fairly complete conceptual picture for the evolution of certain rand
 om data by these PDE that has emerged over the past few years. The punchli
 ne is that the evolution of the law of the solution is determined by a com
 pletely integrable system of kinetic equations that describes the clusteri
 ng of shocks. This approach allows the introduction of powerful methods fr
 om integrable systems\, and suggests new lines of attack on related proble
 ms.\n\nBio:\nI currently work on the following areas in mathematical physi
 cs:\n\nKinetics of phase transitions and models of domain coarsening.\nInt
 egrable systems and random matrix theory.\nStatistical theories of turbule
 nce.\n\nThe common theme in my work in these areas is the use of integrabl
 e systems.The methods of integrable systems bridge several areas of mathem
 atics\, linking deep algebraic structure with powerful computational techn
 iques. I am mainly interested in the unexpected appearance of integrable s
 tructures in several probabilistic models. I am also interested in the con
 struction of random fields in several applications (in particular\, random
  surfaces and turbulent fluid flows). If you're a beginning or prospective
  grad student and you don't know what these words mean\, here is a rough t
 ranslation: I prove theorems about ensembles of solutions to various equat
 ions of physical importance. My work is roughly at the intersection of dyn
 amical systems\, PDE and probability theory.\n\nI am also fascinated with 
 the idea that biology can inspire nanotechnology. I collaborate with sever
 al labs on the use of self-assembly to design containers\, devices and sup
 ramolecular assemblies. Here is a link to a brief documentary explaining p
 art of our work. Interested in a longer explanation? Here is my talk at th
 e Frontiers of Science meeting in 2012. My work on self-assembly involves 
 mainly modeling and scientific computation\, but there is certainly intere
 sting mathematical structure to be discovered. \n*************************

 fic needs not addressed by the typical accelerator\, StartX Med was develo
 ped by Divya Nag\, a StartX alumni who founded Stem Cell Theranostics and 
 her company co-founder\, Andrew Lee. The two sought to bring additional re
 sources like wet/dry lab space\, animal testing facilities\, clean rooms a
 nd specialized instruction on med-tech intellectual property and the FDA a
 pproval process to medical companies.\n\nToday StartX Med focuses on "Adva
 ncing breakthrough healthcare technologies by accelerating the development
  of Stanford's highest-potential medical entrepreneurs". We do so by focus
 ing on people in order to develop a community and educate our founders in 
 their efforts to transform healthcare. We support founders across the enti
 re innovation life cycle in biotechnology\, medical device\, health IT\, c
 are delivery innovation\, imaging & diagnostics.\n\nStartX Med companies a
 pply through the same competitive StartX process and work along side the e
 ntrepreneurs in the StartX program.\n\nWe take 0% equity from founders. \n

 l applications to Biology\, in particular I am interested in integrating t
 he information provided by phylogenetic trees\, community interaction grap
 hs and metabolic networks. We use computational statistics\, in particular
 \, nonparametric computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap and MCMC
  to draw inferences about complex biological phenomena\, such as the inter
 actions between the immune system and cancer.\nI enjoy teaching using R an
 d bioconductor and web-based tools.\n\nI have collaborations in the medica
 l school doing image analysis\, drug resistance in HIV and Microbiome Data
  Analysis.\n\nMy specialty: Mining complex (messy is a better word) biolog
 ical datasets. \n*********************************************************
